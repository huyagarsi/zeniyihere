Skinnygirl is&nbsp;slamming a new report that accused <b><a href=#>Bethenny Frankel</a></b> of stealing her Skinnygirl Cocktails business’ name from the Skinny Cow ice cream brand.</p><p>In an exclusive statement to <i>Us Weekly</i> on Wednesday, August 17, a Skinnygirl company spokesperson said,&nbsp;"The allegations by <b>Sam Pugliese</b>, published by Bauer Publishing’s <i>In Touch Weekly</i>, are baseless and without merit. Skinnygirl is a wholly-separate, federally registered, trademark that was developed independently by Ms. Frankel."</p><p>"Any assertion to the contrary is inaccurate and defamatory and will be treated accordingly," the spokesperson continued. "Skinnygirl and Ms. Frankel will not tolerate irresponsible press and will hold accountable anyone attempting to damage the thriving international brand she created and built from inception."</p><p>Skinnygirl's denial follows a report published in the August 29 issue of <i>In Touch</i> magazine, in which Skinny Cow founder<b>&nbsp;</b>Pugliese accused the reality star of getting the idea for her company’s name from his popular brand of frozen treats. “She stole my name,” Pugliese told the publication.</p><p>The businessman also alleged that the<i> Real Housewives of New York City</i> star, 45, visited his office several years ago to ask for help as she launched Skinnygirl, which has since become one of the fastest growing liquor brands on the market.</p><p>“I tried to help her, but … she’s a little wacky — I basically threw her out of my office,” Pugliese claimed to <i>In Touch</i>.</p><p>The entrepreneur — who says Skinny Cow’s parent company, Nestlé, could “sue the hell” out of Frankel — added, “There’s no way she will be honest about this.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>As fans of <i>RHONY</i> know, Frankel was previously confronted about the alleged brand name theft by costar <b>Dorinda Medley</b>’s beau, <b>John Mahdessian</b>, in an April 2016 episode.</p><p>“His brand is called Skinny Cow. You’re a cow, I’m a girl. That’s the difference,” she angrily stated during an unforgettable argument at Medley’s lingerie party, before clarifying, “Skinny Cow, Skinnygirl.”</p><span class=caption></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabnaSdsq%2B62Gadq5meoLKtecOim6esXajBpq3LZqqkoZ6jxqi10aVkn6qfonq0t8inpbJlk6TEbsOTbGxpaGBk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
