In his hometown of Farmersville, Texas, about an hour northeast of Dallas, he attended church and became a youth group leader in his home state of Texas, was an A student, and a star athlete in football, basketball, and track. He attended college at North Texas State University.</p><p>But then, a visit to a friend in California changed Watson’s life forever.</p><p>Entranced by the hippie counterculture brewing on the West Coast, Tex Watson decided to move there — where he met mass murderer <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Charles Manson</a>. Tex Watson became Manson’s right-hand man and helped carry out his vision for seven grisly murders in August 1969.</p><h2>Tex Watson’s Early Life Before Moving To California</h2><p>Charles Denton Watson Jr. was born on December 2, 1945, in Dallas, Texas. He grew up in a Methodist family, believing that the best way to achieve the “American Dream” was to work hard, get an education, and lead a moral life.</p><p>For a long time, Charles Watson complied with this vision. He was an honor-roll student and a church youth group leader.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-201208 alt="Charles Tex Watson" width=800 height=827 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/charles-watson.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-201208 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Bettmann/Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>Charles “Tex” Watson helped kill seven people in August 1969.</span></p><p>Upon graduating from high school, Tex Watson chose to go to North Texas State University in Denton. Denton was a far cry from his small-town upbringing and some believe that it was here that Watson’s character began to slip as he descended into the party scene.</p><p>When funds ran low, Watson took a job with Braniff Airlines as a baggage handler. He got free flights as a perk of the job, so he flew to Los Angeles about eight times in two months to visit an old fraternity brother.</p><p>Tex Watson quickly fell in love with California — and he never looked back.</p><h2>Charles Watson Meets Charles Manson</h2><p>Tex Watson attended Cal State Los Angeles with the idea that he’d finish earning his degree, but he dropped out after less than a semester to enjoy life in the fast lane. He got a job selling wigs and got his fraternity buddy, David Neale, a job at the same store.</p><p>One fateful evening, he was driving home and picked up a hitchhiker.</p><p>In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Watson’s words</a>:</p><p>“Hitchhikers were pretty common on Sunset, and I pulled over to pick one up. When he told me his name was Dennis Wilson, it didn’t mean anything to me, but when he said he was one of the Beach Boys, I was impressed.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-201209 alt="Charles Watson At Court" width=600 height=892 data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Watson-at-court.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-201209 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Bettmann/Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>Charles “Tex” Watson arrives for his arraignment on charges of conspiracy and murder.</span></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wilson, The Beach Boys’ drummer</a>, then directed Watson to his home on Sunset Boulevard, in the Pacific Palisades area of Los Angeles.</p><p>Tex Watson was shocked when he pulled up — the place was enormous, far different from his modest home in Texas — and even more surprised to be invited in.</p><p>In the living room, Watson found a man sitting on the floor with his guitar, surrounded by five or six young women. “He looked up,” Watson later recalled, “and the first thing I felt was a sort of gentleness, an embracing kind of acceptance and love.”</p><p>Another man at the house introduced them: “This is Charlie, Charlie Manson.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-200297 alt="Charles Manson" width=900 height=604 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/charles-manson.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-200297 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Hulton Archive / Stringer </span><span class=caption-body>1969 police mug shot of American cult leader and murderer Charles Manson.</span></p><p>Then they all got stoned.</p><p>Tex Watson was hooked, but not on drugs — at least not at first. It was the sense of community that drew him in.</p><p>“Here I was, accepted in a world I’d never even dreamed about, mellow and at my ease. Charlie murmured in the background, something about love, finding love, letting yourself love. I suddenly realized that this was what I was looking for: love. Not that my parents and brother and sister hadn’t loved me, but somehow, now, that didn’t count. I wanted the kind of love they talked about in the songs — the kind of love that didn’t ask you to be anything didn’t judge what you were, didn’t set up any rules or regulations.”</p><p>Manson’s “family” turned also to LSD. Regular acid trips, combined with <a href=# rel=noopener>Charles Manson</a>‘s bizarre teachings, led to strange behavior — behavior that started to draw attention to the group.</p><h2>Tex Watson Becomes Part Of The Manson Family</h2><p>Tex Watson moved in with Manson and his followers at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Spahn Ranch</a>, a run-down former movie set, in November 1968. This is where Watson got his nickname; George Spahn, the 80-year-old, nearly blind owner of the ranch, immediately placed Watson’s Texas accent.</p><p>In isolation at the ranch, Manson began to preach a strange gospel: he convinced his followers that he was a god-like figure whose every word should be obeyed.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-223132 alt="Spahn Ranch" width=900 height=601 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ranch-overhead.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-223132 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Ralph Crane/The LIFE Picture Collection/Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>Watson lived with the Manson Family at Spahn Ranch from late 1968 until he fled California for Texas in October of 1969.</span></p><p>Manson used the term “Helter Skelter” — borrowed from a Beatles song – to describe a coming “race war” between black and white people. According to him, all his “family” had to do was burrow underneath Death Valley, wait out the battle, and emerge as the only remaining white people and heir apparent to the human legacy.</p><p>The only trouble was that it was taking too long for war to break out — which meant the Manson Family would have to incite that war themselves.</p><p>Tex Watson described the events leading up to the murders in an interview:</p><p>“After about two weeks of taking these drugs and becoming just void of conscience, Manson said, ‘Hey, I want you to go out and kill these people. To go up to this place and kill everyone who is there.’ He gave us the orders, the directions…he told the girls to write something witchy on the walls. Here I was, a naïve Texas boy without a conscience…thinking that the world was going to come to an end tomorrow.”</p><p>Tex Watson would head down a dark path.</p><h2>Watson’s Role In The Manson Family Murders</h2><p>In the wee hours of Aug. 9, 1969, Tex Watson and three of Manson’s girls — <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Susan Atkins</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Patricia Krenwinkel</a>, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Linda Kasabian</a> — headed to the home of Hollywood director Roman Polanski and his wife, the actress <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sharon Tate</a>.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-200299 alt="Manson Family" width=900 height=606 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/manson-family.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-200299 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Bettmann/Getty</span><span class=caption-body>Manson family members and murder suspects Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkle, and <a href=# rel=noopener>Leslie van Houten</a>.</span></p><p>Tate was home at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10050 Cielo Drive</a> with four other people: coffee heiress <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Abigail Folger</a>, ex-boyfriend and Hollywood hair stylist <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jay Sebring</a>, Folger’s boyfriend and Polanski’s friend from Poland <a href=# rel=noopener>Wojciech Frykowski</a>, and visitor Steven Parent.</p><p>Atkins later recalled Tex Watson waking up Frykowski in the living room whispering this eerie message: “I’m the devil, and I’m here to do the devil’s business.”</p><p>Tex Watson and the three others proceeded to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">stab Tate and her friends dozens of times</a>. Watson himself, apparently the only one with a gun, shot 18-year-old Parent four times and shot Frykowski twice. They scrawled “PIG” on the front door in the victims’ blood before leaving the gruesome crime scene of the <a href=# rel=noopener>Tate murders</a>.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-224900 alt="Roman Polanski At Sharon Tate Crime Scene" width=900 height=622 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/polanski-at-tate-crime-scene-1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-224900 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Julian Wasser/The LIFE Images Collection/Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>Roman Polanski sits on his blood-spattered porch soon after his wife, Sharon Tate, and unborn child were murdered by the Manson Family. The word “PIG” can still be seen scrawled on the door in blood.</span></p><p>Yet <a href=# rel=noopener>Manson, though he didn’t kill anyone himself</a>, wasn’t satisfied with his underlings’ work; he felt they needed a lesson in murder. So the next day, he accompanied the previous night’s killers and supervised the <a href=# rel=noopener>murder of grocery story executive Leno LaBianca and his wife, Rosemary</a>, a businesswoman.</p><p>These murders were some of the most gruesome and shocking in American history.</p><h2>Tex Watson Tries To Escape After The Tate-LaBianca Murders</h2><p>Tex Watson fled to Texas on Oct. 2, 1969, nearly two months after the murders. The race war that Manson predicted never happened.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-225174 alt="Charles Tex Watson In Court" width=800 height=536 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/charles-tex-watson-in-court.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-225174 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Michael Haering/Herald Examiner Collection/Los Angeles Public Library</span><span class=caption-body>Charles “Tex” Watson following a court appearance on September 28, 1970.</span></p><p>His freedom back home didn’t last long, though. He was arrested on Nov. 30, 1969, and charged with seven counts of first-degree murder. His parents and siblings were shocked and horrified. His attorneys fought his extradition to California for nine months but ultimately failed.</p><p>After losing an attempt to plea insanity, a jury found Watson guilty of seven counts of first-degree murder. As fate would have it, California abolished the death penalty in 1972, a year after Tex Watson was sentenced to death. So instead of the death penalty, he received life in prison.</p><h2>What Happened To Charles “Tex” Watson And Where He Is Today</h2><p>Tex Watson became a born-again Christian in prison and an ordained minister. Weirdly enough, Rosemary LaBianca’s daughter supports Watson’s ministry, called Abounding Love, though Watson has been accused of using money from his ministry for personal purposes.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-225173 alt="Charles Tex Watson With His Memoir" width=600 height=754 data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/charles-tex-watson-with-his-memoir.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-225173 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Herald Examiner Collection/Los Angeles Public Library</span><span class=caption-body>Charles “Tex” Watson holding a copy of his memoir, Will You Die for Me?, in 1978.</span></p><p>He claims to feel remorse for the crimes he committed and the lives he ended 50 years ago. “I hate what I’ve done,” he once said. “I hate having to be the person that had committed a crime that’s so hideous. I hate that.”</p><p>Tex Watson tried to explain why he chose to play a role in the slaughter:</p><p>“Growing up a passive person not communicating my desires, I entered college to please my parents. I looked up to older college men as father figures, while fearing failure and angry….The crimes ended up bringing my parents to their knees, causing devastation, hurt, humiliation, and much embarrassment. My siblings were left to hold them up from all the emotional pain, which I so deeply regret.”</p><p>The prisoner married and had four kids before California banned conjugal visits in prisons. He divorced in 2003.</p><p>In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">October 2016</a>, a parole board denied Watson’s request for parole for the 17th time since his conviction.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-200295 alt="Charles Watson Now" width=900 height=507 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/watson-now.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-200295 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>Tex Watson in an undated prison photograph.</span></p><p>One prosecutor framed Tex Watson as an unrepentant mass murderer after the parole hearing: “These were some of the most horrific crimes in California history, and we believe he continues to exhibit a lack of remorse and remains a public safety risk.”</p><p>Watson remains in prison in San Diego County, just north of the Mexican border.</p><p>While <a href=# rel=noopener>Charles Manson died</a> in 2017, Charles “Tex” Watson lives on, continuing to appeal the decisions of the court in an as-yet unsuccessful bid for freedom. He has spent much more of his life behind bars than he ever spent free — and it looks like, as a result of his ghastly crimes, he’ll die there too.</p><p>After this look at Tex Watson, learn more about the <a href=#>Manson Family</a>.
