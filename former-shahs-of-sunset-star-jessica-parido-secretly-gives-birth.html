I contemplated never posting about it and carrying on but IM A MOM, I have a son, a beautiful little miracle who I’ll cherish the rest of my life and to not share this would be not sharing me.”</p><p>In the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">social media reveal</a>, the Bravo personality shared a black-and-white shot of herself cradling her baby bump in a tight black dress. She also posted a video of her bursting into tears during an ultrasound appointment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shahs-of-Sunset-Jessica-Parido-Baby-Boy.jpg><p>The California native explained her emotional response in the caption. “Since I was 15 years old I was told that the high doses of chemotherapy I got to fight my leukemia would cause me to be sterile. It was something I struggled with accepting for years. After 15 years and countless specialists, I accepted the fact I would never have children of my own. God had other plans for me. The level of shock and disbelief I had when I found out I was pregnant naturally was unimaginable. I had spent half of my life believing I would never feel these feelings.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The former reality star, who did not name the father of her child, added: “To say this came without struggle would be a lie. The traditional family I’ve dreamed of my entire life is not something I have. The vision of love, marriage then baby I had wanted is gone.”</p><p>The new mom&nbsp;was <a href=#>married to <strong>Mike Shouhed</strong></a> for less than five months before <a href=#>they separated in August 2015</a>.</p><p>“I’m so happy for you to get what you always wanted and feared you couldn’t and couldn’t, being a mom,” Parido’s ex-husband, 40, commented on her reveal. “I know in my heart and feel it in my soul that you will do an amazing job as a parent. You have a lot of love to share and wisdom from life to pass along to him. May God continue to bless the both of you with endless health and happiness.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGafp6KisrN50qGYoatdpLNuv9Snqp6sXajBor6Mo5ysq5mYrm68wKugnaddqLKkvsSto7Jll57Dpr%2BMm6CrrJhk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
