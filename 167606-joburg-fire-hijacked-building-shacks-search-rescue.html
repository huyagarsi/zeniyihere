These buildings are not safe."<p class=align-left>@musa_mansa said:</p>"Most of those buildings need to be demolished and rebuilt. Since they got hijacked, no maintenance has been done."<p class=align-left>@Queen_Nandi said:</p>"The numbers are increasing*...☹️"<p class=align-left>@terrencemgxamza said:</p>"JHB CBD is a tinderbox as more and more previously designated office buildings are converted to residential units.

And I suspect EMS is inadequately prepared for as there is no addition of personnel and fit for purpose high rise fire apparatus."<h2>Johannesburg street explosion cause still unclear</h2><p class=align-left><strong>Briefly News</strong> previously reported that the Johannesburg CBD descended into chaos when a section of Lillian Ngoyi Street (also called Bree Street) <a href=# title>split into two</a> after an explosion on Wednesday, 19 July.</p><p class=align-left>While initial reports indicated that a gas line caused the explosion, authorities are not sure about the true root of the disaster.</p><p class=align-left>Egoli Gas, which manages the municipal gas lines in the city, released a statement claiming that it cannot be sure that a gas line caused the explosion.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop6yp7jYZ5qoZqqWfLS71K2fZpmWp7akrY5qbXBuYGt6q7vBrqmgZZaev6Z5x6KhmpubmrFurtSio52hnpx6tLTAnKKsZaOarrOvx2apnquTqrJw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
