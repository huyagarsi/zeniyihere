In fact, according to Altitude Tickets, the chance to spend one-on-one time with the pop star on his upcoming <i>Purpose</i> tour is valued at a whopping $2,000.</p><p>The ticket-selling site, which recently opened its presale VIP tickets for the tour, lists three different VIP experiences for fans hoping to meet the 21-year-old “What Do You Mean?” singer: $375 for the “Where Are You Now” VIP #Purpose Experience, $925 for the “I’ll Show You” VIP #Purpose Experience, and $2,000 for the Ultimate #Purpose Experience.</p><p>As part of the priciest package, fans will have the chance to snap a selfie with Bieber at a meet and greet, and be seated in a barricaded section close to the stage. They will also get a behind-the-scenes tour and a plaque to commemorate their time spent with the singer.</p><p>A source close to Bieber tells <b>Us</b>&nbsp;that only 20 such packages were available, and have since sold out.</p><p>The slightly less pricey “I’ll Show You” VIP package also includes a meet and&nbsp;greet, though fans will have to take photos grouped. Both those who shell out the big bucks for the Ultimate package and those who opt for the “I’ll Show You” package will be allowed to enter the venue early and receive one digital download of his new album, <i>Purpose</i>.</p><p>The cheapest package, Bieber’s “Where Are You Now” offering, includes a premium merch package, entrance into the venue through a dedicated VIP door, a plaque, and one digital download of <i>Purpose</i>.</p><p>Bieber’s largely teen fan base took issue with the expensive packages and took to social media to complain about the steep price tag to meet their idol.</p><p><span>“Not even a prostitute asks for so much money #justiceforbrokeliebers,” one fan tweeted.</span></p><p>“The prices are kinda not fair and kinda not cool #justiceforbrokeliebers,” another wrote.</p><p>“For $2000 he should let us live with him for a week #justiceforbrokeliebers,” yet another quipped.</p><p>But lest fans think they won't get the opportunity to see their favorite singer, “Justin also offers $50 tickets – the only other major pop superstar to do that, making it possible for a family of four to go see his show," the source adds.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Bieber will kick off his 58-date North America tour in Seattle on March 9, 2016.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajraOptq95waKcm52iqHpzfI9pZKmtoqW8tLGMnq%2BpnaKesq%2BvxGagrGWZqXq4u9Gtn2ahpGLEcoGWcWtrZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
