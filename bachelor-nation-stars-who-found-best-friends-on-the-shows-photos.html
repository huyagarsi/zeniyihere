I’m <a href=#>very close with both of them</a>. They’re awesome people.”</p><p>Underwood noted that the&nbsp;Bachelor&nbsp;process connects contestants on another level. “I just think it’s like a dynamic after the show that not a lot of people realize,” he said. “You just go through something unique and then, you know, Garrett and I got along great. So it’s just a friendship!”</p><p><a href=#><strong>JoJo Fletcher</strong></a>, for her part, stayed pals with <strong>Becca Tilley</strong> — to the point that the former Bachelorette asked her bestie to <a href=#>be a bridesmaid in her wedding</a> to <a href=#><strong>Jordan Rodgers</strong></a>. “She was just in town to wedding dress shop,” Tilley revealed exclusively to&nbsp;Us&nbsp;in September 2019.</p><p>The&nbsp;Cash Pad&nbsp;star then detailed her experience. “I had that moment,” she recalled. “I don’t get teary-eyed. That’s just not my personality, but I think when you try on a dress and it feels the most you, you know that’s the one.”</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href=#><strong>Jade Roper</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Carly Waddell</strong></a> were pals long before they fell in love with <a href=#><strong>Tanner Tolbert</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Evan Bass</strong></a>, respectively. So, they leaned on each other when they ended up pregnant with their second children at the same time.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I called her and we had just done a podcast and we were together and I think I peed, like, four times a day,” the singer told&nbsp;Us&nbsp;exclusively in May 2019. “And I was like, ‘Why am I peeing so much since you’re not? And you’re the pregnant one.’ [Jade] was like, ‘I don’t know. I think the universe is telling you you’re pregnant.’ And I was like, ‘No way. I’m not pregnant.’”</p><p>Waddell <a href=#>informed Roper as soon as she confirmed the news</a>. “Then I called her and I was like, ‘Jade, I’m pregnant,’ and she was like, ‘No s–t,’” she recounted.</p><p>Scroll to revisit some of the best Bachelor Nation friendships.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BXrqS0xKWmq2WelsGqu81mqq2Zoqh6uLTOZp2orZ6ZeqOx0q1kn6qZmrulv4yopWasmJp6tLTOsKpmqJikwbC%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
