And then of course that was that <a href=#>one Utah State cheerleader</a> that stole the hearts and minds of the entire nation.</p><p>But females aren’t just landing in the headlines throughout March Madness for being cheerleaders. Between <a href=#>Hailey Van Lith’s wild video with Donovan Mitchell</a> and <a href=#>Haley Cavinder’s provocative video</a> after Miami’s upset win, it has been one thing after another with the players as well.</p><p>Big picture, it will be interesting to see how UCLA fares against Gonzaga this week. The rivalry between these two teams is pretty epic, and the stakes really couldn’t be any higher.</p><p>If Jaime Jaquez Jr. drops another 24 points on 11-of-19 shooting performance, the Zags are going to be in big trouble. He has been on fire throughout the entirety of March Madness.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Draymond kept it real on the Andrew Wiggins situation.<a href=#>https://t.co/3doXnQk386</a></p><p>— Game 7 (@game7__) <a href=# rel=noopener>March 22, 2023</a></p><p>But Drew Timme is just as likely to go off as Jaquez is. And if he does, the Bruins don’t have much of a way to slow him down.</p><p>One way another, this promises to be a Sweet 16 match-up for the ages.</p><p>Will UCLA be able to send Gonzaga home early? Time will tell, but either way, their cheerleaders will be there rooting them on every step of the way.</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=#>Zion Williamson’s Massive New Tattoo Causes A Stir (Photos)</a></p><p>A graduate from the University of Texas, Anthony Amador has been credentialed to cover the Houston Texans, Dallas Cowboys, San Antonio Spurs, Dallas Mavericks and high school games all over the Lone Star State.
