The Patriots added another Super Bowl to their dynasty. Officials missed a blatant pass interference call that likely cost the Saints a trip to the title game. That one had such an impact that the league changed the rules this offseason, and now both offensive and defensive pass interference is reviewable.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But perhaps the most talked about story was the legend of <a href=# rel=noopener>Tony Romo</a>. The CBS broadcaster brings an infectious energy to the games he called. He also seems to have a knack for predicting plays before they're about to happen.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>It's that combination of talent that's made Romo the most popular NFL broadcaster around. It makes sense that CBS would want to keep him as long as they can. But with one year left on Romo's contract, how much would CBS have to spend?</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-279832 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/GettyImages-959329790.jpg alt width=900 height=679 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-279832 class=wp-caption-text>Matthew Eisman/Getty Images</p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Romo's current deal pays him $4 million per year. A head coaching gig could net Romo double that amount, all the way up to an $8 million salary. Rumors have swirled that teams are giving Romo a long look, though nothing is official yet.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>If Romo were to receive a head coaching offer, CBS would likely have the chance to match the deal. But would they want to?</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Back in the day, having a guy like Romo in the booth was nearly invaluable. The audience only had three or four different viewing options, so the most popular voice could cause people to tune in.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Now? There's just a lot more variety. Even beyond specialty networks like NFL RedZone, people just have more options for things to watch on a Sunday, even if it's not football-related. And if you're at a noisy bar or restaurant watching the game, you don't particularly care who's calling it.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Then again, Romo may opt for the ease of broadcasting over more money as a head coach. Broadcasters certainly still have a lot of preparation, but it's far less taxing than coaching.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Until Romo firmly states the opposite, CBS has to prepare like it's the last year they'll have Romo in the booth. And you can be sure they'll get as much mileage as they can out of him.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2FjqGmsGWdqrCpecisZK2nnq56s7vMqGSwp6KptW7Azmaam6tf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
