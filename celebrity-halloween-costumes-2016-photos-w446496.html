No one loves <a href=#>Halloween</a> more than celebrities — and they didn’t disappoint this year, with some of them going all out on multiple looks.</p><p>Not content with a store-bought costume, <a href=#><strong>Taylor Swift</strong></a> borrowed her friend <a href=#><strong>Ryan Reynolds</strong></a>‘ actual Deadpool outfit for a hang with several girlfriends. “You’re the best Deadpool inside contact ever,” <a href=#>the “Love Story” songstress wrote via Instagram</a>, thanking the Proposal actor for the very special favor.</p><p>The Pennsylvania native and the Green Lantern star became friends through <a href=#><strong>Blake Lively</strong></a>, who wed Reynolds in 2012. The pop star and the <a href=#>Gossip Girl</a> alum formed a bond in 2015 after Lively publicly confirmed that she’s a Swiftie. Months later, the pair met up in Australia, where they hung out with a koala bear — and the rest is history.</p><p>Rather than borrow a look from someone else, Halloween queen <a href=#><strong>Heidi Klum</strong></a> wore something original — then put it on five “doppelgänger” models who accompanied her to her famous party.

He saw himself in the mirror and he lost his mind!”</p><p><a href=#><strong>Justin Timberlake</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Jessica Biel</strong></a>, meanwhile, accompanied son Silas as characters from the movie Trolls. The “Mirrors” crooner contributed the song “Can’t Stop the Feeling” to the soundtrack and voices the character Branch in the film.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Earlier this month, the former boy bander revealed that his little one recognized his dad’s voice in the animated movie. “He knows all the characters already!” Timberlake told Entertainment Tonight ahead of the film’s premiere. “It’s crazy!”</p><p>Keep scrolling to see some of the best celebrity costumes of 2016:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6poJyspaeytHvCnqOemqKewbp5x5qjpaenmrKvecKoqq2tnZrAbn6Pam1mqJikwbC%2FjLBrbW5kboNw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
