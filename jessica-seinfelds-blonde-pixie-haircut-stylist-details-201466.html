But not <strong>Jessica Seinfeld</strong>.</p><p>The 42-year-old wife of <strong><a href=#>Jerry Seinfeld</a></strong> went blonde in May, just months after debuting a pixie hairstyle in December. "Oh, it went down today. @spratula aka Sarah Spratt taught me you can never too old or too brunette to be blonde," Seinfeld wrote, along with a picture debuting her new look.</p><p>Although some stars may have trepidation with making such an eyebrow-raising transformation, the founder of Baby Buggy and cookbook author was all in from the start. "I don't internalize it that much," Seinfeld told <strong><a href=#>Us Weekly</a></strong> of her haircut and color at the Baby Buggy Bedtime Bash on June 4 in New York City. "I'm a very impulsive person. It just happened one day. I'm over 40; I don't really care about much."&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Her colorist Sarah Spratt of NYC's Rheanne White Salon made the change and credited Seinfeld for the daring look. "Jessica is a pretty spontaneous person who loves change so I wasn't too surprised when I got a late night text (with pics) asking to be blonde," Spratt tells <strong>Us Weekly</strong>. "At first she wanted it very platinum but we settled on something lighter on the ends with a more natural dark blonde root."&nbsp;</p><p>Since making the switch to blonde, Seinfeld hasn't had any regrets. "We just had our first root touch-up yesterday and she told me the husband and kids (and all the other people she loves) adore it," Spratt tells <strong>Us</strong>. "She told me some friends even told her to never go back to brown! Jerry is very supportive of her expressing her style and individuality and that's such an awesome thing."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmmZ6ZpanGcLrEsKpoopWowKqvwGaqnqGem7KtsNJmmaWnnpmybrzIsaCeZZiWtrOv1K1krKypoba0wIydnK2ZmaHAbn6Pamtvbg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
