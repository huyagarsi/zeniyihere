Dominik has made it a point to reach his extremity in order to cause trouble for his family. He once made a bold statement regarding his custody and opened the closed book of the iconic rivalry between Eddie Guerrero and Rey Mysterio.</p><p>Speaking on the ‘<strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Out Of Character</a></strong>’ podcast, Dominik once shared his relationship with his uncle Eddie Guerrero. “I feel like I’ve always been drawn to Eddie, whether it’s early 90s Eddie, WCW Eddie, or it’s ‘I’m your papi’ Eddie,” he said. The Judgment Day member also went ahead to disclose the respect Dominik had for Eddie.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Dominik said that Eddie was everything to him and was the one he looked up to. He was also asked if he wanted Eddie to win the iconic ladder match between Eddie Guerrero and Rey Mysterio. Dominik was 100% in support of the choice. He would have loved to walk back to the Guerrero family.</p><p>The newest member of The Judgment Day also claimed that he wouldn’t have entered the world of professional wrestling if his uncle and father had not planted the seeds of wrestling in his head. Being a kid, he was a massive part of the storyline too, even without knowing it. All this led him to step into the WWE ring at a very young age.</p><p><strong>Discover More: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">REVEALED: Real reason why Rey Mysterio never entered the Royal Rumble match</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-why-was-dominik-mysterio-s-custody-brought-out-before-the-public><strong>Why was Dominik Mysterio’s custody brought out before the public?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_COM_20230131_2354_17_6971-1024x768.jpg><p>Back in 2005, Eddie Guerrero and <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rey Mysterio</a></strong> were great friends. However, the relationship was soon stained, and these friends turned into bitter enemies. Eddie threatened to expose a dark truth about the Mysterio family. He claimed that <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dominik Mysterio</a></strong> was his son, thus bringing both families into the limelight.</p><p>Giving a very strong take on the story, he said that the Mysterios were having a problem conceiving. In addition to that, he was not in a good relationship at home, which eventually led him to have a son out of wedlock, and Dominik was a result of his actions. He claimed himself to be Dominik’s biological father, who later gave Dominik to the Mysterios to raise him as their child.</p><p>The storyline received a mixed bag of responses. The extremely dramatic storyline finally concluded with Rey Mysterio receiving Dominik’s custody.
