Rising through the rank, he finally received a sergeant’s badge. In the mid-2010s, Sean began his reality TV career with A&E’s “Live P.D.” as an in-studio analyst. Impressed by his on-screen charms, the A&E executives finally handed him a hosting job at the “P.D. Cam” network broadcast. Beyond the respectable six-figure net value,<strong> Sean towers beyond the six-foot mark of height.</strong> His full sleeve tattoos, rather than his height, describe his physical features.</p><h2><span id=How_did_Sean_Larkin_get_the_nickname_8220Larkin8221>How did Sean Larkin get the nickname “Larkin?”</span></h2><p>Like his paint, Sean Larkin’s moniker also had meaning. Speaking to SiriusXM in March 2019, Sean recalled an incident in which he took down a suspected suspect without a weapon. At the time, his captain was not pleased with the technique used and dubbed him “F-Stick.”Soon enough, everyone, from fellow officers to residents in his neighborhood, started calling Sean “Sticks.”</p><h2><span id=Sean_8220Sticks8221_of_Larkin_Married_Wife_Children>Sean “Sticks” of Larkin Married, Wife & Children</span></h2><p>Sean “The Sticks” Somehow, Larkin’s commitment to his career may have led to the demise of his marriage to the former wife of Tammy Jean Stocks.

After the breakdown of his married life, Sean became effectively a single father. Alyssa, a pre-medical student at Oklahoma State University, studied physiology and nutrition at college. When Sean told Patrick and Alyssa about Lana Del Rey, the teenagers were blown away.</p><h2><span id=Post-Divorce_Lana_Del_Rey_Girlfriend_Dating>Post-Divorce: Lana Del Rey Girlfriend & Dating</span></h2><p>Sean Sticks Larkin with Lana Del Rey’s girlfriend circa September 2019Sean “Sticks” Larkin’s love life made headlines in 2019.

Trolls online noticed a 12-year-old discrepancy between Sean and his girlfriend Lana.</p><p>Acknowledging the romance in her October 2019 LA Times interview, the “Summertime” songwriter called Sean “a decent cop” who gets “both sides of the thing.”In mid-December 2019, Sean and Lana made their relationship official via Instagram. Both the veteran law enforcement officer and the singer posted their photographs on the social media website. Sean and his girlfriend Lana made their red carpet debut at the pre-2020 Grammy Gala hosted by Clive Davis and the Recording Academy. The “Live P.D.” star wore a black suit for the event, while his date for the night was a cream dress and a black out-of-the-shoulder dress.</p><h2><span id=Split_of_Lana_Del_Rey>Split of Lana Del Rey</span></h2><p>After six months of dating, Sean “Sticks” called Larkin and Lana Del Rey to leave. Talking to the New York Times in March 2020, the law enforcement-turned-reality star hinted at the break. Per Sean’s interview with NYT, he and Lana were friends right now. And if they’re busy with their schedule, they’re always “talking and not.” Although still in a relationship, the pair performed “boyfriend, girlfriend, kind of stuff together.”Sean said the now-former lovebirds met in New York City and immediately hit it off.
