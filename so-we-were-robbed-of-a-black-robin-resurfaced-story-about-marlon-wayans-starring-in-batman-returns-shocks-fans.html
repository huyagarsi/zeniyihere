According to Cinemablend <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">and</a> a movie fan on Reddit, the actor and comedian received $100,000 for his role as Robin in director <strong>Tim Burton</strong>‘s 1992 <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">film</a> “Batman Returns.” The part was later passed on to actor <strong>Chris O’Donnell</strong>.</p><p>The 49-year-old producer previously admitted to these findings during a 2018 Gizmodo interview.

I was cast, I was paid, and everything. I still get residual checks. Tim Burton didn’t wind up doing three, [director]<strong> Joel Schumacher </strong>did it, and he had a different vision for who Robin was. So he hired <strong>Chris O’ Donnell</strong>.”</p><p>As news about a Black Robin made its way to Twitter, fans noted that Wayans was financially compensated for his “trouble.” Still, one person tweeted, “So we were robbed of a Black Robin?”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>So we were robbed of a black Robin <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/WMqW30yUpn</a></p>— S. ♏ (@Bright_Eyes973) <a href=#>April 2, 2022</a></figure><p>Another said, “Whoa!!!
