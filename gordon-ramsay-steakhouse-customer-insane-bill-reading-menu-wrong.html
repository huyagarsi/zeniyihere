Paige added.</p><p>"Or so I thought."</p><p>The couple was shocked when the bill showed that they owed more than $600, far above what they expected.</p><p>Paige went back to the menu to double-check and discovered that the Kobe was in fact $35 per ounce, not per four ounces.</p><p>Despite his costly error, he says that he takes all the blame and wouldn't go back on the meal.</p><p>"I wish <a href=#>Chef Ramsay</a> was there to come out and call me a donut for f***ing this up lol," he said of the error, which he posted about on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/08/NINTCHDBPICT000671218590.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/08/NINTCHDBPICT000640457251.jpg><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in News</h2></p><p>"I enjoyed the hell out of it.
