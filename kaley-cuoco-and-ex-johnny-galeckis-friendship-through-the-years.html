When the series began, they sparked an offscreen romance but <a href=#>kept their relationship out of the spotlight</a> before calling it quits.</p><p>“We dated really early on for almost two years. When we did the pilot, I was crushing so hard on Galecki, but he had a girlfriend,” Cuoco recalled during a November 2020 episode of <a href=#><strong>Dax Shepard</strong></a>‘s “Armchair Expert” podcast. “We got together and <a href=#>just fell mad for each other</a> for two years, but then we broke up. Luckily, Johnny and I came out of it so brilliantly and we’re closer today than we ever were.”</p><p>Each of the actors moved on in the wake of their romance, with the <a href=#>8 Simple Rules</a> alum marrying <a href=#><strong>Ryan Sweeting</strong></a> in 2013. Before she <a href=#>filed for divorce</a> in October 2015, Cuoco said she felt “lucky” that her then-husband was such a fan of Galecki.</p><p>“Johnny is actually one of my best friends. It’s a situation that ended well. I understand sometimes it doesn’t. It could have gone horrible,” she said on <a href=#>Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen</a> in September 2015. “He’s one of my dearest friends and Ryan loves him. Johnny loves [Ryan]. I got lucky.”</p><p>Following her split from Sweeting, the Charmed alum and Galecki <a href=#>sparked speculation of a reunion</a> more than once. Though Big Bang Theory fans would have loved to see the longtime costars rekindle their romance, Cuoco eventually <a href=#>tied the knot with <strong>Karl Cook</strong></a> in June 2018, with Galecki there to witness the magical moment.</p><p>“Deepest congrats to the newlyweds. Love you both so much @normancook & @mrtankcook So moved by tonight. ❤️,” the actor gushed via Instagram at the time, posing in between the married couple.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Galecki, for his part, <a href=#>welcomed son Avery with <strong>Alaina Meyer</strong></a> in November 2019. The pair split one year later.</p><p>Scroll down to relive Cuoco and Galecki’s fun-filled relationship, from costar couple to friendly exes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkuKK4xLJknK2fmLxurc2dZJ6wXZ%2B8qbrNsmSgmZyasKy10madq6GVo7G0tMipZK2goqTCqLSMrZ%2BeZamarrO%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
