Honestly! He is… please, he is.”</p><p>During her revealing interview, Blunt also discussed filming a particular scene with <strong>Tom Hanks</strong> — in only her underwear.</p><p>“That was embarrassing. I think it was strange for him,” noted the actress, who’s married to <strong>John Krasinski.</strong> “He said that friends of his saw that scene and were disturbed by it.”</p><p>In fact, Blunt said filming sex scenes generally were far from exciting. “I find it so… clinical. The whole thing and technical that I never got excited,” she said. Stern then asked if a man she was filming a love scene with ever got aroused.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Uh… once,” Blunt replied. “I think the reaction was… we were filming, and we were like, ‘oop!’ … [I felt it] against my leg!”</p><p>She said, however, that she would “never” go home and tell her husband about the incident. While Blunt was transparent about nude and sex scenes on Stern’s show, she was more coy when she discussed her former relationship with Michael Buble. Stern outright asked Blunt about the cheating allegations, which prompted Blunt to reply: “I don’t know, it’s complicated… I never want to talk about it. I can’t do it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaepZmhxm6uy66lrWWVrb2trcinqmavmK56tLTEZq2erJ%2BasW661J2cZquTmrumecinZKyhk5a%2FqruMprBmrJmpwG5%2Bj2psa2lgZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
