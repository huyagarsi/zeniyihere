She played Mrs. Windham-Vandermark, the ex-wife of Hayworth Windham. After their divorce, Hayworth was found dead in his bedroom, and his second wife, Brooke Windham (<a href=#>Ali Larter</a>), was on trial for his murder.</p><p>In Raquel’s first iconic Legally Blonde scene, her character receives a visit from Elle and Emmett Richmond (<a href=#>Luke Wilson</a>) at a spa.
