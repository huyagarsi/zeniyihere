Maggie merely needs to sign the papers. It needs to be done in front of a notary and thankfully the hospital has one in house. The end was in sight. They didn’t have children. They didn’t even have to worry about the cat.</p><p>They decided the cat was going to Ben. Meaning there’s nothing in the way of this divorce. Maggie can sign the papers and be done with it. Maggie was working a shift when that hot new doctor from the rural clinic came back. His name is Dr. Loren Johnson. He’s gorgeous. He was applying for privileges at Chicago Med. He’s worked with Maggie before. The two get along well and now she’s single she can truly enjoy whatever may come next.</p><p>However, Johnson did come back because of a patient. The patient’s name was Kaitlin Neely. Her water broke when she was fifteen weeks pregnant. It’s too early for viability.</p><p>The patient was also in a lot of pain. Maggie called in Dr. Asher to care for the woman. Johnson wanted to stay involve as well. It was revealed that this woman was in pain because she lost her baby two weeks ago. Her doctor refused to perform a D&E. It went against his supposed values. And so he left a rotting fetus in this woman for weeks until the pain became unbearable.</p><p>Asher was telling Dr. Ahmad about it during one of their breaks. Dr. Ahmad mentioned her own patient. She was treating a kid by the name of Alex whose appendix burst.</p><p>She informed Dr. Marcel about the case. Marcel rushed the kid into surgery and he pulled off an easy surgery. It actually felt a little too easy. Marcel had the appendix go to pathology because he said something about it didn’t feel right. Ahmad had watched the surgery and so heard Marcel say something was wrong. She just didn’t know what it could be.</p><p>It ended up being a good thing that Marcel sent that sample to pathology. The appendix showed cancer. Marcel was able to get all the cancer out when he did the surgery and that meant there’s a chance that Alex might not need chemotherapy.</p><p>His cancer was found early on. It was completely removed. Alex’s parents were still worried because hearing cancer was never great. Especially not with a fifteen year old boy. They wanted to speak to an oncologist. They wanted to make sure that all the cancer was gone.</p><p>Dr. Archer was also treating someone. It was a busy day in the ED. Archer was treating someone that his son brought in. Sean was a drug counselor at a facility and Damon was a patient there.</p><p>Damon couldn’t breathe. An x-ray showed that he had fluid in his lungs. It might have been caused by drugs. Or his drug usage over the years. Archer had to warn his son that Damon might still be taking drugs. Not that Sean’s faith in his father ever wavered. He knew his father could help get Damon better. He also knew that if it was drugs that Damon could getter better with additional treatment at the facility.</p><p>When Archer wasn’t helping Damon, he was doing a favor for Sharon Goodwin. Sharon had her ex-husband come in for a follow up. Bert hasn’t had a physical in years.</p><p>She was worried he might have dementia because he showed confusion earlier. He was forgetting things. He could be a risk to her grandson and so she talked him into doing a physical. She had Archer do the physical until Dr. Charles could stop by. It was all a set up to get Bert seen by Charles. Charles was a friend of Bert’s. He also knew what to expect from someone with dementia.</p><p>It didn’t help that Bert has a family history of dementia. Charles checked him over. He saw worrying signs and he had Bert wait for him at the coffee shop while he saw to the rest of the results. Charles was already worrying about what to say to his friend when he came across another sad case. Charles met a patient that had a lobotomy. Those have been illegal for over sixty years. Their patient looked about sixty-five to seventy. This procedure was done on him as a kid. He probably had a disciplinary issue and that’s what the doctors thought could solve it.</p><p>His name was Jimmy. He was technically Dr. Ripley’s patient. Only the doctor was on the brink of tears once he realized this man had been lobotomized. Ripley was also a troubled kid. He was on a lot of prescriptions. The doctors didn’t know what to do with him and then he grew up. He grew out of the issues. He went on to become a doctor. He was now good at his job. He knew what it was like to be written off and there was nothing he could do to help Jimmy. They couldn’t even contact his family because Jimmy kept saying his sister needed help.</p><p>The doctors involved CPD. They did a look at the address associated with the number Jimmy remembered. The cops later saw that his elderly sister had passed away. It was natural causes. Jimmy must not have been able to wake her up that morning and so he went looking for help. In spite of everything, Jimmy still knew enough to try getting help for his sister. She was the last family he had and now he’s on his own. He’ll probably have to live in a facility. Jimmy aside, Charles’s day wasn’t over because he had to break the news to Bert.</p><p>Bert refused to believe he had a problem. He accused Sharon of manipulating him. He said that she wants to lock him away and so he refused any more tests because he didn’t want to give her an opening. Meanwhile Asher was able to perform surgery on Kaitlin. She had to wait to get her temperature down. Then she performed the D&E.</p><p>The whole experience was so trying on Kaitlin that she might not try to get pregnant after this. She definitely wasn’t going to move back to that farm in the middle of nowhere with doctors that didn’t see her. Her husband said he would sell the family farm so that they would never have to go back there.</p><p>As for Archer’s patient, he took a turn for the worse. He flatlined. He died on the table and that did waver Sean’s faith in him.</p><p>Dr. Ahmad’s patient had a bad reaction to a medication. She was able to stop it. She saved his life and he later left the hospital cancer free. Ahmad tried to pull that medication from distribution in the hospital only the board disagreed with her. And there was nothing Marcel could do about it.</p><p>And Bert later changed his mind about additional tests because he knew he had a problem.</p><p>THE END!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaW1nk522pK3GqGSmnZRiv6avwKlkaWpdZ35ufpNmqp6Zo6S7boWMnqeiq5%2BZsm6BjKJkppmbmnqiec%2Brpqaho5p6qnnWoqOlZZ6aw6a%2BjKWcmq6VYsawwY4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
