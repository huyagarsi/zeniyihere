He also told shareholders how he never plans to sell its stakes in nearly 30% of Occidental Petroleum and 9% of five large Japanese trading houses, but he reiterated that he has no plans to buy the oil producer outright.</p><p class="sc-dkzDqf dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 gLFytU itaLjB">Berkshire’s eclectic mix of businesses, combined with the strong performance of its investments, delivered a profit of $37.57 billion, or $26,043 per Class A share, in the fourth quarter. That’s more than double the $18.08 billion profit, or $12,355 per Class A share, that Berkshire reported a year earlier.</p><p class="sc-dkzDqf dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 gLFytU itaLjB">But Buffett cautioned that investors should largely ignore those bottom line figures because they are swayed so much by the paper value of its investments. Instead, he has long urged investors to pay attention to Berkshire’s operating earnings that exclude investments.</p><p class="sc-dkzDqf dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 gLFytU itaLjB">By that measure, Berkshire reported a 28% jump in operating earnings to $8.48 billion, or $5,878.21 per Class A share. That’s up from $6.63 billion, or $4,527.06 per Class A share.</p><p class="sc-dkzDqf dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 gLFytU itaLjB">The three analysts surveyed by FactSet Research predicted that Berkshire would report quarterly operating earnings of $5,717,17 per Class A share.</p><p class="sc-dkzDqf dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 gLFytU itaLjB">Berkshire’s stock has set a series of new records in recent weeks, most recently peaking at $632,820 per Class A share Friday morning as investors eagerly anticipated Buffett’s letter. Buffett is revered for his remarkably successful track record and the sage advice he has offered over the decades. His annual letter is always one of the best-read reports in the business world.</p><p class="sc-dkzDqf dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 gLFytU itaLjB">Berkshire also spent $2.2 billion repurchasing its own shares in the fourth quarter, bringing the total to $9.2 billion for the full year.</p><p class="sc-dkzDqf dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 gLFytU itaLjB">___</p><p class="sc-dkzDqf dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 gLFytU itaLjB">For more AP coverage of Warren Buffett look here: <a href=#>https://apnews.com/hub/warren-buffett</a> or see Berkshire Hathaway news here: <a href=#>https://apnews.com/hub/berkshire-hathaway-inc</a> and follow Josh Funk online at <a href=#>https://www.twitter.com/funkwrite</a> and <a href=#>https://www.linkedin.com/in/funkwrite</a></p><p>Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.
