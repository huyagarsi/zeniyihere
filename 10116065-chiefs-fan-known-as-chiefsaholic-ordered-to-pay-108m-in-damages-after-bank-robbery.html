Tulsa County District Judge Tracy L. Priddy made the ruling last Wednesday.</p><p>Babudar reached a <a href=# rel=noopener>federal plea agreement</a> in February after admitting to committing 11 robberies in seven states that resulted in more than $800,000 and laundering that money through casinos. He's required to pay at least $532,675 in restitution to the financial institutions he robbed.</p><p>Frank Frasier, Garcia's attorney, said Monday that he and his client are aware that it will not be easy to collect the money.</p><p>"But the point is two things," Frasier told Merrill and Purdum. "He'll never be able to profit from this. Say he writes a book in prison, say he does the Lifetime or Hallmark movie ... anything he obtains from that will be paid to his creditors. The second part overall is this: The judge sent a message that you cannot profit from crime. You cannot profit by greater notoriety, you cannot profit from clicks, getting more views, getting more likes."</p><p>Babudar was arrested in Bixby on Dec. 16, 2022, after threatening Garcia with a black CO2 pistol during a robbery at the Tulsa Teachers Credit Union. He was released on bond in February 2023 and escaped after making $100,000 in two bets on the Chiefs. He was <a href=# rel=noopener>apprehended</a> on July 7 in California after nearly four months of evading authorities.</p><p>The 29-year-old had built a large social media following as @Chiefsaholic on X and Instagram. An <a href=# rel=noopener>ESPN investigation</a> in November revealed that his online persona was mostly false.</p><p>Garcia is still dealing with the trauma of the crime and had to leave her job, Frasier added.</p><p>"This has affected her children, her marriage," he said. "She'll never be able to go back into work in banking. [It affected] all aspects of her life."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWt9d4GMnJ%2BinZaoeqetzWaip6eno3qiv4ycn6KdlqiuqbvLoppmp6KZsrOxw2arqGWglsZufY9xpGahnmKxornAoJysZZGbwaa%2BjJuYp6Ndp7yjrsSrsA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
