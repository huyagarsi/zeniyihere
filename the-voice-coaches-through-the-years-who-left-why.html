When <a href=#>The Voice</a> debuted on NBC in 2011, no one knew what to expect from yet another singing competition show. However, it quickly became a success, with <a href=#><strong>Carson Daly</strong></a> as host and a group of successful, entertaining coaches ready to find the next superstar.</p><p>Kicking off the first season, <a href=#><strong>Blake Shelton</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Christina Aguilera</strong></a>, <strong>CeeLo Green</strong> and <a href=#><strong>Adam Levine</strong></a> filled the coaches’ chairs, each bringing their different expertise to the table. Though the Maroon 5 frontman was the first to win season 1 with singer Javier Colon, the country superstar then went on to <a href=#>win the following three seasons</a> in a row with <strong>Jermaine Paul</strong>, <strong>Cassadee Pope</strong> and <strong>Danielle Bradbery</strong>. Each winner was awarded $100,000 and a record deal with Universal Music Group.</p><p>Aguilera and Green both took season 4 off and were temporarily replaced by <a href=#><strong>Shakira</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Usher</strong></a>.

It was my only kind of outlet.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Fans were shocked at her admission. Through the years, multiple other coaches have come and gone, but only one other had a similar impact. At the end of season 16, Levine <a href=#>announced that he would not</a> be returning <a href=#>following a suspicious performance</a> with the other judges at an Upfront presentation in New York City. At the time, he appeared lackadaisical, something both press and advertisers noticed.</p><p>In a 2019 Instagram post, he hinted that there was no bad blood, adding he would “<a href=#>be back to say hi very very soon</a>.” However, in 2020,<a href=#> he wrote “no thank you”</a> when a fan asked whether he’d return.</p><p>Scroll through the gallery below for all the coaches through the years and why they left the show.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BptaZ51aignJ1dmLyir8eeqmasmKe8trPHZquhnV2usqK%2B0mauoaddobKnwIywn7JnkaG2pLXAZqKesaNifnV7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
