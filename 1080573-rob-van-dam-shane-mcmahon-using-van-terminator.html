RVD says no one asks him permission to use his moves, and explained how Paul Heyman showed Shane McMahon his famous ‘Van Terminator’ move:</p><p class=p1>“No, no, no. It doesn’t work that way. Sometimes it does. I can’t remember, I’m sure people have told me, I wouldn’t have watched the WWE pay-per-view (PPV) and then said “Oh my god – ’cause I don’t watch it because especially when I’m doing it the last thing I want to watch is work. So, I don’t remember who the first one to tell me, but I did hear Paul open up one time and say he showed&nbsp;Shane-O footage of me doing the Van Terminator saying “You think you could do that?” Totally gave my move to him. It happens, you can’t copyright moves. I’m just stoked that – and a little mystified – that more people haven’t ripped off all my moves.”</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>During the interview</a>, RVD also talked about how often he wrestled high, saying it was almost 100% of the time in ECW, and slightly less during his final WWE run. He also said that while he can look back on it now and see where there’s an argument, he didn’t think it affected his skills at all.</p><p>Read More:&nbsp;<a title="Rob Van Dam On New IMPACT Wrestling Deal Being Good Business" href=# rel=noopener>Rob Van Dam On New IMPACT Wrestling Deal Being Good Business</a></p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfY9xZ25vY2K%2FsK6Mr5inZZSWum6%2Fx5qlnmWdmLqitM6nZK6rmaO0bsLAp2StnaKitq%2Bt06ip</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
