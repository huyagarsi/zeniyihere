He just posted ion social media that he and Remy have nothing to hide and that’s why they have each other’s passwords. Here’s his post:</p><p>‘Life is great l! 🙏🏿 #blacklove #thegoldenchild #numericalslaughter #underrated Feb 15th’ Papoose captioned his post.</p><p>Someone&nbsp;gushed over the couple and wrote in the comments section: ‘You both are my favorite people in the world!! Power couple for real!!!!! ❤️’</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BtoZm4mHLaI/</p><p>Another follower said ‘It’s like that when no cheating has taken place that’s when the love is real but let someone be ready for the games that’s when the password change but your love is real enjoy every bit of it💞’</p><p>Someone else, on the other hand, believes that ‘Sometimes a friend might send a personal text about their issue(s) for girls/men talk only. So it’s not always about hiding or cheating but protecting the confidentiality of your friend’s business. My 2 cents. Not worth much but it still has value.’</p><p>A person posted ‘It’s nothing wrong having each other password call trust I got that to papoose people mad because they can’t have their man’s&nbsp;password 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣’</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BtAdbC_n6cr/</p><p>Papoose is really in love with Remy, and he made this clear more than once.</p><p>He recently <a href=#>gushed over her</a> with a video from a wedding that the two of them were invited at.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Remy is well-aware of her snap back, and she&nbsp;<a href=#>recently shared a photo on social media</a>&nbsp;where she is flaunting her stunning figure and fashion game.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeglr2wu9KeZKyZqah6qbGMmqWdZaKaurp5zJpkoZmmmnqmrcKhZKismJq%2FtHnPmqqsr5%2BnsbR5wZ6amq2jmnq1tMSyZKGZppp6r7vToaCnn12pvG60yJ2cZmpkaX93g44%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
