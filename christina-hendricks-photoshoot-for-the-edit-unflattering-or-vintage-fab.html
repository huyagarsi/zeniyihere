She is talking about the end of Mad Men, and the final season which will premiere in just a few weeks. I’m okay with the Mad Men cast talking about “the end” right now, but I wish they would remind people that the final season is being split into two section, the first section premiering in April and the second half to premiere…TBA? Sometime next year I think. So we’re going to have to go through all of this “THE END OF MAD MEN” again next year, that’s my point. Anyway, <a href=#>you can read the full Edit interview here</a> and here are some highlights:</p><p><strong>Christina on Mad Men’s consistency:</strong> “I am a TV addict. But so often I find a show that I get really excited about, and then by the second season I’m like, ‘I don’t care anymore.’ The consistency [in Mad Men] really is something to be proud of. And that is down to Matthew Weiner [the show’s creator] and his writing.”</p><p><strong>Learning from Joan Holloway: </strong>“It’s hard to tell. Are the things I’ve learned because of the show? Because of the character? Or is it just because eight years have gone by and I would have grown anyway? If you can’t learn or hope to gain some characteristics from playing a role for eight years, then you’ve missed an opportunity.” So what has she gained from Joan? “I think some of her ability to bounce back after something horrible arrives in your life. That and her confidence.”</p><p><strong>How she wants Joan to end:</strong> “I want her to do the Thelma & Louise thing with Roger. Just go out with a bang. My fear is that Joan is going to turn off the lights of the office that night and just go home.”</p><p><strong>The fashion and quality of Mad Men:</strong> “It was never a question that viewers wouldn’t get it – that combination of intelligent writing and amazing interior design, mixed with extremely well put-together fashion. I don’t think we’d seen men like Don Draper for a long time. And the women in tailored dresses… When the show came out, people were wearing jeans with their underwear out – maybe one of the worst crimes in fashion we’ve ever had. I think people were craving that tailored sense of style.”</p><p><strong>Christina’s personal style:</strong> “I like clothes that are vintage-inspired and whimsical. You need some basics in your closet, but I always tend to go to the piece that has a sparkle on it, or a pearl.” Today, she is wearing brogues, a very un-Joan state of affairs. “These flats hurt my feet more than heels,” Hendricks bemoans with a grimace. “I’m good in a three-inch heel, that is the most comfortable for me.”</p><p><a href=#>[From The Edit]</a></p><p>I’ve never been able to understand how heels are more comfortable than flats for some women, but I guess it happens if you, like, just LIVE in heels and that’s what your feet and calf muscles are used to. Christina also says that she’s “put in a request for several items from Joan’s apartment that I would like to purchase, I’d like those reminders.” I’m not sure if Joan’s apartment really stands out that much for me. Don’s apartment? For sure. Even Peggy’s old apartment was pretty cute. What would I want from the Mad Men set? Let me think… I’d want some of the ashtrays, just because I would imagine they have so many laying around. I’d want some of the prop liquor bottles too. Oh, yes! I’d want some of the prop advertising mock-ups! Some of those mock-ups are awesome.</p><p>Anyway… as for this editorial… I’m not feeling it. I usually love The Edit’s photoshoots, but this is not Christina’s best look overall. I think it’s the hair?</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/CH3.jpg alt=CH3 width=455 height=624 sizes="(max-width: 455px) 100vw, 455px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/CH1.jpg alt=CH1 width=577 sizes="(max-width: 771px) 100vw, 771px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/CH2.jpg alt=CH2 width=577 sizes="(max-width: 757px) 100vw, 757px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of <a href=#>The Edit</a>.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmbG1nbH95e8KhqaKrpJ67oqvHnqWdqpmYuLSrz6GmraejnbywwL6fpquXpJ2yoLHDoquYrZ6buaLA056poqaXlLyzq9Wipa2Zl5p6p63BaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
