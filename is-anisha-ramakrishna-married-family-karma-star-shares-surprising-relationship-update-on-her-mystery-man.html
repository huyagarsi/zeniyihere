After shocking her fans with a surprise <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">engagement announcement on Instagram</a> back in September, Anisha has been very insistent about keeping the details of her love-life private, and that won't be changing any time soon even after their nuptials. During her interview, Anisha joked that their marriage worked because he's "never around." "I like to say our marriage works because he’s never around. He’s very busy, and he’s always working. Even if he were to be on the show, he wouldn’t actually be there," she shared.&nbsp;</p><p>In another interview with Bravo's '<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">The Daily Dish</a>' ahead of her wedding, the 'Family Karma' star revealed her wedding plans and described the event as a "small, intimate ceremony” at her parents’ home in Miami. She also added that they might throw a reception party in the spring of 2023. "I am thrilled with my fiancé, and we have the blessings from our parents, and that’s what is most important to me,” she said. Despite keeping things low-key, Anisha and her partner are looking forward to their new life together. "I am looking forward to building a beautiful life with my partner, creating lovely new memories with both our families and dedicating time to my businesses again,” she added.</p><h2 class=split>How did Anisha Ramakrishna meet her husband?</h2><p>Fans of 'Family Karma' may be familiar with Anisha's unsuccessful attempts at finding love and the parental pressure placed upon her to settle down. But following her split from her ex Vishnu, Anisha moved back into her parents' home and decided to focus on building her business, while occasionally dipping her toes into the dating pool via dating apps. In Anisha's words, after swiping right on "thousands of guys" and finally going on a date with two men, she finally found her "unicorn" amongst one of her two dates. When her co-stars tried getting the lucky guy's name out of Anisha's mouth, the designer refused to spill the tea by claiming that he had a very high-profile job and wanted to keep their relationship on the down-low for his career's sake. Though Anisha hinted at revealing the identity of her man post-marriage, it looks like we'll have to wait a little longer to finally learn the identity of Anisha's unicorn.&nbsp;</p><p>'Family Karma' Season 3 premieres on Sunday, November 6, 2022, at 9/8c on Bravo, and will be available for streaming the next day on Peacock and Bravo app.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRooaNirq%2B10qGYZqqRoq6svsisn6eZXaKus77InptmnpGitq3FjKSYq6WRYsC1rdFmqqGZoprAbr%2FUq6eroaOeu6h50Z6jmqyZpLu0tMipZK6olJbBpnnOp2ShnaJiurq%2F056psmWdlrs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
