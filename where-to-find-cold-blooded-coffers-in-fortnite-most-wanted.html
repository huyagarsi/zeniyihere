As dangerous as its members are, they have delivered new weapons, vaults, and even a never-before-seen chest type for players to find. This chest type is fittingly named the Cold Blooded Coffer, and you will need to discover at least five in order to complete one of the event’s latest quests. Here is how to search and open Cold Blooded Coffers in Fortnite and what rewards you will earn by doing so.</p><h2>All Cold Blooded Coffer locations in Fortnite Most Wanted</h2><p data-injection=true>Unlike most chests on the map, Cold Blooded Coffers are held exclusively inside <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">all of the Cold Blooded Vault locations</a>, each being located in the middle of Brutal Bastion, Shattered Slabs, and Faulty Splits. However, in order to open these vaults, you must have a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cold Blooded boss’s Vault Keycard</a> in your inventory. If that is done, the keycard can then be used on the kiosk to the left of the vault to break it open.</p><p>As shown below, two Cold Blooded Coffers spawn at the back of each Cold Blooded Vault, both of which will surround a Legendary-rarity chest. Upon opening one, players will be rewarded at least one Mythic weapon, two shield items, one health item, and 1,000 Gold. We recommend also using that Gold at an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ace’s Exotics or Armory vending machine</a>, as these shops allow you to purchase any weapon in the current loot pool.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Cold-Blooded-Coffer-Location-Fortnite-Most-Wanted-Chest.jpg><p><strong>Related</strong>: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">How to increase your Heat Level by using a burner pay phone in Fortnite Most Wanted</a></p><p>You can also expect to earn goods after matches from these special chests. While the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Most Wanted quests</a> are live, players will earn 1,500 Infamy after five Cold Blooded Coffers are opened. This Infamy is then used to progress through the event’s rewards tracker, ultimately inching you closer to unlocking the limited-time <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gold Blooded Ace skin</a>.</p><h3>About the author</h3><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/058043756cd8985ccf06cd8266268f2a?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamepur.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F01%2Fcropped-gamepur_favicon-1-192x192.png&r=g2x" height=96 width=96 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Ryan Willcox</h3><p class=author-url></p><p class=author-desc>Ryan Willcox is a Staff Writer at Gamepur.
