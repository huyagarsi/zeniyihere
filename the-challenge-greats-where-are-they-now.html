In 1998, the spinoff began as Road Rules: All Stars. Season 2, the title was changed to Real World/Road Rules Challenge.</p><p>By season 19, the show made many changes and converted to The Challenge, although it’s usually combined with a unique title — Rivals, Battle of the Sexes, Bloodlines, etc.</p><p>While the cast now competes for a giant sum of money, that wasn’t always the case. When the show began, the members won a trip for two to San José, Costa Rica. Fast forward to 2017, <a href=#>when The Challenge season 30</a> cast competed for $1 million.</p><p><strong>Ashley Mitchell</strong>, who began on Real World: Ex-Plosion, currently stands as the competitor with the most winnings, earning $1,121,250 in her two Challenge wins. <a href=#><strong>Johnny “Bananas” Devenanzio</strong></a> holds the title for male competing in the most Challenges at 20, while <strong>Cara Maria Sorbello</strong> holds the female title, being cast on 14.</p><p>Although it began as only Real World and Road Rules alum, cast members from <a href=#>Are You the One?</a>, <a href=#>Big Brother</a>, <a href=#>Ex on the Beach</a>, Geordie Shore, <a href=#>Vanderpump Rules</a>, The Amazing Race, Bad Girls Club, Party Down South and<a href=#> Survivor</a> have since joined the show.</p><p>“We see ourselves now as the challenge show,” producer <a href=#><strong>Emer Harkin</strong> told Variety</a> in 2020 about adding in other shows. “It’s really about marrying the best of the best from those shows with the best of ours.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>How big are reality star salaries?
