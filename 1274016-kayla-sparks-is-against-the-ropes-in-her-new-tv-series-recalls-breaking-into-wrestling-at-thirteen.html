Since then, she’s appeared on AEW Dark, Beyond Wrestling, Capital Championship Wrestling, and Mission Pro to name a few spots fans can see her work.</p><p>While she’s not wrestling, she also served as the executive producer of an upcoming series that is set to be released this week. Kayla Sparks recently appeared on the <a href=#>Shining Wizards Wrestling Podcast</a> to discuss Against The Ropes, her new Roku show.</p><p>“It’s inspired by the story of how I got into wrestling when I was thirteen years old. It’s a story about coming of age and the struggles I went through coming out, which is also in there… my ‘coming out’ story. It’s something I haven’t seen before on TV or movies, with the wrestling, and the high school drama, and all that stuff. It’s going to be a fun show and I can’t wait for it to come out.”</p><p>Sparks went on to explain the difference between wrestling at thirteen years old compared to now since her return to pro wrestling:</p><p>“When you’re a kid, a teenager, you’re still growing. You’re still trying to figure life out. So, I definitely see it through a new set of eyes now with wrestling. When you’re a kid, you take things personally, or you’re kind of naïve to some things. Like, back then in the locker room, it was a different vibe and atmosphere back then. But now, I feel like it’s more supportive. The support system is great. The women in the locker rooms are very supportive of each other, which is great. In a good way, it’s because I’m a lot older now, it’s different now. I see it differently. I’m still very passionate and I love what I do. Now I see it in a better, more positive way.”</p><p>“Against The Ropes” is set to be released on Friday, January 7 on Roku.</p><p>https://twitter.com/ATR_TheTVSeries/status/1478884670792163329</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZFwa2lpZmK4osXLmmSsqJGnuLR5yKxkmp%2BRnru0wIytn55loqS9pr%2BMoqVmoJWneq%2Bx1marr2Wjmr%2BqsdJmqZ6bkaG5tHnBq5yao5mjtG61za2mZq%2BimsC1uMinnmaZpGLBqbXRrZyepg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
