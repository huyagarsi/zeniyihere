Moss also alleges that <span class=hiddenSpellError>Manziel</span> was telling people his name was Billy:</span></span></p><p class=ui-droppable><span class=mceItemHidden>We all know Vegas stories can get extremely crazy involving celebrities. This is going to sound wild, and maybe hard to believe, but this is what we're hearing regarding Johnny <span class=hiddenSpellError>Manziel</span>.</span></p><p class=ui-droppable><span class=mceItemHidden>Our sources tell us <span class=hiddenSpellError>Manziel</span> was at a popular night club on the strip Saturday night. The QB entered wearing a blonde wig, a fake mustache, glasses, and a hoodie.</span></p><p class=ui-droppable><span class=mceItemHidden><span class=hiddenSpellError>Manziel</span> introduced himself as "Billy." He was there into the 3am hour and when it came time to pay the bill, he asked to have it comped because he didn't bring cash and also didn't want to put it on his card.</span></p><p class=ui-droppable>However, the sources tell us he ended up paying with his card and signing the check.</p><p class=ui-droppable>By 3am he appeared to be enjoying the party scene that Vegas is known to offer.</p><p class=ui-droppable><span class=mceItemHidden>The club had <span class=hiddenSpellError>Manziel</span> and his crew placed at a VIP table close to the DJ booth. The table is located in one of the darkest areas of the club.</span></p><p class=ui-droppable><span class=mceItemHidden><span class=hiddenSpellError>Manziel</span> dined at the club's restaurant before going to the nightclub. He was seated at the most private area in the restaurant, which is still out in the open. And yes, he ate with his wig and glasses on.</span></p><p><span class=mceItemHidden>According to <span class=hiddenSpellError>Boeck's</span> sources,&nbsp;<span class=hiddenSpellError>Manziel</span> had been seen by multiple people at Las Vegas' Planet Hollywood Casino on Saturday night before the Browns' season finale against the Pittsburgh Steelers.</span></p><p><span class=mceItemHidden>The report mentioned <span class=hiddenSpellError>Manziel's</span> being served at a bar in the casino but did not reference his attire or appearance.</span></p><p>So a few things.</p><p><span class=mceItemHidden>Moss credits unnamed sources for his information. So take that into account. If true, however, this disguise angle would explain some of the oddities about <span class=hiddenSpellError>Boeck's</span> initial report.</span></p><p><span class=mceItemHidden><span class=hiddenSpellError>Boeck's</span> report of <span class=hiddenSpellError>Manziel's</span> hanging out in Vegas seemed shaky due to the lack of documentation. Even with casinos banning photography around the tables, it's unlikely a guy like Johnny Football could go out on the town in Las Vegas on a Saturday night without a single tweet, picture or <span class=hiddenSpellError>Instagram</span> post from people who see him in public.</span></p><p>But so far, the only image of the quarterback supposedly taken that night came from the man himselfâ€”<span class=mceItemHidden>a picture of <span class=hiddenSpellError>Manziel</span> </span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">with his pet puppy</a> <span class=mceItemHidden>captioned "#<span class=hiddenSpellError>SaturdayNights</span>."</span></p><p><span class=mceItemHidden><span class=hiddenSpellError>Manziel</span> posted to <span class=hiddenSpellError>Instagram</span> on Saturday night with a <span class=hiddenSpellError>geotag</span> pinned on Avon, Ohio. On its face, this would give <span class=hiddenSpellError>Manziel</span> a bulletproof alibi against these Vegas allegations. But&nbsp;<span class=hiddenSpellError>Instagram</span> allows users to tag pictures with any location their hearts desire, meaning <span class=hiddenSpellError>Manziel</span> <span class=hiddenSpellError>could've</span> technically been anywhere when he posted the image.</span></p><p><span class=mceItemHidden>So this leaves us with two possibilities.&nbsp;<span class=hiddenSpellError>Manziel</span> really was at home, and all these Vegas reports are the sleep-deprived fever dreams of <span class=hiddenSpellError>bored</span> members of the media. Or <span class=hiddenSpellError>Manziel</span> pulled the social media version of a Ferris <span class=hiddenSpellError>Bueller</span> and </span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">attached a mannequin</a> to his doorknob and caught a red-eye to the Vegas on Saturday. He did miss an appointment with the team Sunday morning, which could mean nothing or a lot of things.</p><p>I can't tell you which scenario happened. All I know is the third season of&nbsp;Serial will involve forensic wig testing and the testimony of bottle waitresses who might have<span class=mceItemHidden>&nbsp;seen <span class=hiddenSpellError>Manziel</span> but the sparklers were very bright.</span><br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaW9oZWaCd3nRnqeoqqRit7C0zaewZqWRo8eqsctmrKydlGLEqrOMmqWdZZaWuKZ5zK6qrZmTnbJuw8eio55loJa%2FtcXIp55moZ5iuaK%2FjK%2BcoJmj</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
