In the case of Jenna Fischer, the story starts with a sex-education video. For patients being discharged from mental-health facilities. As the actress <a href=#>tells the New York Times in an interview</a>, Fischer arrived in Los Angeles fresh from college and certain she’d be a steadily working actress within a year. She even got a pager to manage her soon-to-be-very-busy schedule. Within six months, she was broke with a dead car and in need of a day job. She explains, “Then one day something extraordinary happened.” Fischer got the fateful page that would put wind back in her sails and make her the face of safe sex. “A number I didn’t recognize was flashing on the screen. Finally, after all the struggle, the years of dreaming, the scene study classes, the movement classes, the voice and speech work, my efforts were about to pay off. I had landed my first real acting job.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjbnzh4go00133h61k888o637@published data-word-count=27>Fischer did her own makeup and wore her own clothes to the shoot, which was done in an apartment bathroom. She recounted the dialogue for the Times:</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjbnzh4or00153h61hp47vkd6@published data-word-count=19><strong>SISTER</strong>&nbsp;Wow, you’re spending a lot of time getting ready.
