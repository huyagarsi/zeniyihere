The singer, 19, has had his braces removed and showed off a before and after picture on his Twitter account. The image shows a straighter, whiter smile that would be worthy of Hollywood. Niall was clearly excited to be getting a new look and tweeted&nbsp;updates to&nbsp;his ten million Twitter followers. "Morning. ! This is it ! I'm goin to the dentist! I think this is my last hour with braces! Oh how I'm gona miss them !

Since then, One Direction have been closely involved in the creative process and had two sittings for their waxworks, which each cost £150,000 to make. Harry Styles was overwhelmed at the idea of being immortalised alongside his bandmates. "We've been to Madame Tussauds and seen the kind of people who are in there. It's crazy to think that we will be up there with them," he said back in March.</p><p id=eu7rFIcWY3kk data-wc=40>Zayn Malik agreed saying, "All the biggest stars in the world get these wax figures made of them and why are we, five normal lads, getting these made?".
