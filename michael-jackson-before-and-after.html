Throughout his career, his dramatic change made him famous, as fans wondered how much surgery he’d had and why his skin had turned white.</p><p style=color:#252525>Michael admitted in a 2003 documentary with Martin Bashir that he only had a nose job. “Only my nose has been changed with plastic surgery,” he said. “It helped me breathe better so I could play higher notes.” “I am telling you the truth: I didn’t do anything to my face.”</p><p>Michael told Oprah Winfrey in the early 1990s that the pale spots on his body were caused by a skin condition called vitiligo. This was the reason for his fair skin. In 2009, Dr. Arnold Klein, a dermatologist, said that was true.</p><p>But other experts say Michael had a lot more work done than just a nose job and a lightening of his skin.</p><h2><strong>Michael Jackson Before And Picture</strong></h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/michael-jackson-first-nose-job.jpg alt="Michael jackson first nose job" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3>First Nose Surgery</h3><p>In 1979, Michael got his first nose job. He said that he didn’t get surgery to make his nose smaller because he wanted to, but because he broke it during dance practice and needed surgery to fix it.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/michael-jackson-nose-job-3.jpg alt="Michael jackson nose job 3" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3>Second Nose Surgery</h3><p>But Michael wasn’t happy with his first nose job, so he had it done again to fix it.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/michael-jackson-third-nose-job.jpg alt="Michael jackson third nose job" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3><strong>Third Nose Surgery</strong></h3><p>Michael’s plastic surgeon, Dr. Steven Hoefflin, said that the second nose job made it hard for him to breathe and “needed more work.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/michael-jackson-chin-job.jpg alt="Michael jackson chin job" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3><strong>Chin Surgery</strong></h3><p>Michael’s chin split unexpectedly in 1988.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/michael-jackson-1992-darker.jpg alt="Michael jackson 1992 darker" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3><strong>Face Surgery</strong></h3><p style=color:#252525>During the 1990s, Dr. Wallace Goodstein worked with Michael’s surgeon. He said that Michael came in for surgery “every two months.”</p><p style=color:#252525>“While I was there, I had about 10 to 12 surgeries,” he said in 2009.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/michael-jackson-nose-job-angle.jpg alt="Michael jackson nose job angle" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3><strong>Nose Surgery Again</strong></h3><p>During the 1990s, Michael’s nose and skin became noticeably thinner and whiter. Michael told Oprah Winfrey at the time that he had vitiligo, a skin condition that made his skin lighter.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/michael-jackson-plastic-surgery-6.jpg alt="Michael jackson plastic surgery 6" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3><strong>Overall Face Surgery</strong></h3><p>Uri Geller, a magician who is Michael’s friend, said that Michael told him he was changing his appearance to “not look like his father.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/michael-jackson-plastic-surgery-8.jpg alt="Michael jackson plastic surgery 8" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3><strong>Overall Face Surgery Again</strong></h3><p>By this time, his face had changed so much that it was hard to tell what procedures he had had. However, Dr. Goodstein said that he had “multiple nose jobs, cheek implants, and a cleft in his chin.” He had surgery on his eyelids, and you name it, he did it.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/michael-jackson-nose-2005.jpg alt="Michael jackson nose 2005" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3><strong>Nose Profile</strong></h3><p>After Michael’s nose had been fixed so many times, it started to cave in. “I fixed [his nose]… Dr. Arnold Klein told Larry King in 2009 that he used fillers. “I used hyaluronic acids, and they worked great. It’s hard to do because you don’t want to put in too much. “And you have to do it just right so that the material flows smoothly.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/michael-jackson-changing-faces.jpg alt="Michael jackson changing faces" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3><strong>Overall Face</strong></h3><p>In 2015, a documentary called “The 10 Faces of Michael Jackson” said that the late singer’s face had been through more than 100 procedures.</p><p><strong>Read More</strong></p><ul><li><a href=#>Julia Fox Weight Loss: When I Was Dating Kenya West, I Lost 15 Pounds!</a></li><li><a href=#>Hilary Rosen Weight Loss: How Much Does She Lose?
