When asked about how she maintains a balance working across multiple companies at once, Wrenkowski said there’s a different vibe when it comes to performing at the <a href=#>National Wrestling Alliance</a> as compared to <a href=#>All Elite Wrestling</a> or <a href=#>Ring of Honor</a>.</p><p>“Yeah, um, I feel like NWA obviously has that historic, sentimental, like value to their promotion like this is one of the longest running if not the longest running wrestling promotion out there,” Madi Wrenkowski said. “So it’s definitely incredible to be on their products so consistently. I feel like though, getting to branch out and do other promotions, like AEW and ROH, it’s different.</p><p>“It’s a different vibe. Their production is they’re doing their stuff in front of huge live crowds. As well as I feel like it not only helps me like continue to hone my craft but at the end of the day when my matches are posted. People are saying like, ‘Oh, this is one-half of the NWA champions.’ So it’s not like they’re like, I’m not promoting both brands because like that’s who I am right now.</p><p>“I am the NWA champion, and I just happen to be on ROH. I think it’s honestly like a win-win for everyone. I get to try my skills against more women, kind of different skill sets as well. I think the women at NWA definitely wrestle a lot rougher and tougher. AEW and ROH it’s a little bit different style. And so it’s nice to have to try and pull out my hybrid skills to try and get the win.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>When asked about appearing on camera during the recent pinfalls count anywhere brawl between Chris Jericho and Roderick Strong on AEW Dynamite, Wrenkowski said her biggest concern was getting hit with some Mr. Softee ice cream.</p><p>“Um, I mean, I was in Austin. And so I was there doing work with them. And I was just informed that they needed someone in this space. And so I volunteered myself was like, I’m not sure what’s about to happen, but it sounds like a me job,” Madi Wrenkowski said.</p><p>“It was fun. I didn’t know what to expect at all. Because it’s wrestling,” she explained, “I was more concerned that I was going to get hit with ice cream, but I did get to get some ice cream after. Soft-serve is good. Mr. Softee. Yeah, it’s good.”</p><p>You can check out our interview with Madi Wrenkowski in the embedded video below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p><a href=#>Madi Wrenkowski Is Already Great, She Just Needed A Platform To Make Everyone See It</a></p><p>What do you make of Madi Wrenkowski’s comments?
