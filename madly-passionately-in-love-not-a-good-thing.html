By July of that year, they had gone Instagram official and in September they were looking seriously loved up, smooching publicly on the red carpet. &nbsp;</p><p id=ejgcNNvApH7 data-wc=24>A year later they were engaged, and JLo was sporting a ginormous rock on her ring finger. By the next summer, <a class=hm-link href=#>they were married</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=eZyxx4B1HKX data-wc=53>My boyfriend and I met in April 2021 too. By July we had been on maybe four dates. We weren't boyfriend and girlfriend for months after that. We cautiously introduced each other to our friends. We didn't meet each other's kids for well over a year. Or feature on each other's social media.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/164d91b5e6ab-rosie-green.jpg><p id=eH0M6pFHhrg data-wc=38>Three years on, his face still hasn't appeared on my Instagram (his chest has, but thatâ€™s another story) and I'm non-existent on his. Our families are not blended. We live separately. In Hollywood terms our progress is glacial.&nbsp;</p><p id=eje2Racg1-i data-wc=33>This speed was and is right for both us and our kids. Divorce is bruising on everyone involved and we wanted to protect ourselves and our children from any more instability and angst.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">More from Rosie</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="How I cracked the secret to midlife happiness at 49" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/fa1d5b923e87-rosie-green-jeans.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="How I cracked the secret to midlife happiness at 49" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>How I cracked the secret to midlife happiness at 49</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="I'm 50 and here's how I mastered any-age festival fashion" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/fb01d15b7e41-festi-fash.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="I'm 50 and here's how I mastered any-age festival fashion" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>I'm 50 and here's how I mastered any-age festival fashion</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Why Bennifer gave divorcee Rosie Green unrealistic blended family expectations" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/4231331f2ae3-jlo-ben.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Why Bennifer gave divorcee Rosie Green unrealistic blended family expectations" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Why Bennifer gave divorcee Rosie Green unrealistic blended family expectations</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=eAC0Y5j4lq8 data-wc=24>But I'll confess there was something about seeing JLo and Ben racing through the stages that made me and my relationship feel less than.</p><p id=evGFcyun4kq data-wc=38>Did the fact that they were making these huge commitments so quickly show that their love was stronger, deeper, more exciting than mine? All the diamonds, the 'love of my life' declarations, the commitment tattoos, the Vegas nuptials...</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0b9d8d8a3435-jlo-ben-affleck.jpg><p id=eAfaqC5qQrl data-wc=56>JLo's latest album, 'T and musical movie '', are both about her relationships and finally finding nirvana with Affleck. There is also a behind-the-scenes documentary called '' that heavily features her and Affleck's relationship. (Affleck points out the irony of the title).&nbsp;</p><p id=eVg0Sd0RvBa data-wc=37>To help inspire her creative team, she showed them the private love letters Affleck wrote to her. A folder of them was left around in the studio for them to thumb through when the fancy took them.</p><p id=e71v_5DtT9 data-wc=19><strong>ROSIE'S COLUMN:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>My boyfriend's fitness gadget nearly finished off our love life - here's what I did about it</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=e0TEl6U3rMd data-wc=42>Wow. Even as someone who writes about their life for a living, this seems extreme. And Ben seems to have always had an issue with being written, sung and talked about. This must be a factor in their current reported marital woes.</p><p id=eNZJwdCSnoT data-wc=45>And from news reports it seems like their love is fading as quickly as it fired up. I'm no psychologist, and nor am I party to their innermost thoughts, but to the outside observer it seems clear JLo loves being in madly, passionately in love.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/fa1d5b923e87-rosie-green-jeans.png><p id=eYbMFi3Phgp data-wc=47>While I was researching new relationships for my book '', I learnt about how a new romantic relationship can affect the brain. How the instability and uncertainty of meeting someone new triggers intense cravings, making it all so thrilling, exhilarating and intoxicating.</p><p id=eS6Q7Pfz3nL data-wc=34>To the outside observer, it seems JLo wants her love to remain in this stage. That she only deems the all-encompassing, grand gesture type of love depicted in movies and music as truly valid.&nbsp;</p><p id=eRskzZqCDwQ data-wc=15><strong>MORE FROM ROSIE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Why I'm not too old to wear a mini skirt at 50</a></strong></p><p id=ehpFfPCQoJT data-wc=28>Most of us recognise that whilst the intensity and the excitement of a first flush romance dials down, other things, such as contentment and closeness, more than compensate.</p><p id=eiWJXTmUdDK data-wc=41>So, whilst I wouldn't wish the pain of a breakup on anyone, I do think for me and for everyone else who is taking it slowly, Bennifer's current struggles serve as a reminder that speedy and showy is not necessarily best.&nbsp;</p><p id=e-F5eyxNJl9 data-wc=11>As for me?
