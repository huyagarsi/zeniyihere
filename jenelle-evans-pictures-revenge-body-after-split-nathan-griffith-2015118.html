She revealed her breakup earlier this month.</p><p>On Aug. 9, the Teen Mom 2 star snapped a racy selfie that showed off her cleavage in a black crop top and pink booty shorts. The next day, the MTV veteran, 23, posted a raunchy bikini shot, sunning herself on the beach.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>????????????</a></p><p>A photo posted by Jenelle Evans (@j_evans8209) on Aug 9, 2015 at 5:07pm PDT</p><p>“Oh u know.. Just chillin,” she captioned the Instagram photo. Later that day she shared three pictures from the gym, mid-workout, writing, “Gotta keep those knees high.”&nbsp;</p><p>And on Tuesday, Aug. 11, she posted about a big milestone, writing, “Wow, down to a size 2. For the first time in my life,” adding, “Can I be conceited for a minute? Lol sorry.”</p><p>The Myrtle Beach, S.C., resident later joked on Twitter of her mom, <strong>Barbara Evans</strong>, “Babs just told me ‘don’t get any thinner!’ Lol.”</p><p>Jenelle and Barbara have been going through a rough patch lately, fighting over custody of Jenelle’s eldest son, <strong>Jace</strong>. The pair have had multiple shouting matches on this season of Teen Mom 2, but appear to be working things out. Babs attended Jenelle’s graduation ceremony in late July.</p><p>The same can’t be said for Jenelle and her former love.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>“I’m enjoying being a mom,” the<a href=#> reality star told ET</a> earlier this month. “I just celebrated my first son’s 6th birthday this weekend and it went fantastic. I am not looking to date anyone at the moment. I am focusing on myself.”</p><p>The pair have a tumultuous past. After Griffith proposed in January, the pair began fighting more than ever, which has been documented on the current season of Teen Mom 2.&nbsp;</p><p>In March, Jenelle charged Griffith with domestic violence when he allegedly choked her and forced her engagement ring off her finger. Then in May, Jenelle was arrested for allegedly attacking Griffith, but the charges were later dropped. They rekindled the flame in June and Griffith attended Jenelle’s graduation ceremony on July 24.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKGeppWhuaZ5xK%2BYp6tdpbakwNSrnKxloprDprrGnmSbp5SueqKy056pZqugoba1ec2aq6GZnmK0s7XFn6CtoF1nfXKBkGpv</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
