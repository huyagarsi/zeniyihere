It was sort of like The Wild Bunch … there was a lot of killing and shooting and riding and dust … sombreros. … It was a pretty good idea, actually. It had everything, and it was certainly as original as The Wild Bunch, but it wasn’t as skillfully written as later stuff.”</p><p>He followed this with The Last Resort which was optioned by Michael S Laughlin in 1969. Milius says, “Neither of them was ever made, but I was able to option them. I had them rented out for like $5,000 a year.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=health-problems></span><span>Health problems</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In 2010 Milius was working on a new project, a film biography of Genghis Khan, and a proposed TV series called Pharaoh, set during the reign of Queen Hatshepsut when he had a stroke.
