However, he has yet not mentioned the actual reason behind his transformation.</strong></p><p><strong>Darrelle Shavar Revis</strong> is a former American <strong><a href=#>football cornerback</a></strong> who spent 11 seasons in the National Football League (NFL). He is widely regarded as one of the finest cornerbacks of all time. And because of his prowess and ability to shut down rival teams' greatest receivers, his spot on the pitch was dubbed Revis Island.</p><p>He entered the University of Pittsburgh before being drafted in the first round in the 2007 NFL Draught by the <strong>New York Jets</strong>, where he spent eight non-consecutive seasons. He also spent time with the <strong>Tampa Bay Buccaneers</strong>, <strong>New England Patriots</strong>, and <strong>Kansas City Chiefs</strong>, each for one season.</p><p>However, Darrelle Revis has been out of competition for roughly five years. As a result, the athlete has gained weight after not participating in sports or leading an athletic lifestyle. Recently, fans noticed the difference in his physique while he appeared for the annual Hall of Fame Game before his induction into the Hall of Fame. Well, here is everything you need to know about his weight gain appearance.</p><p>Also, check out the&nbsp;<strong><a href=#>weight gain</a></strong> stories of <strong><a href=#>Jess Harding</a> </strong>and <a href=#><strong>Julia Roberts</strong></a>.</p><h2>Darrelle Revis Was Recently Body-Shamed for His Weight Gain Physique!</h2><p>Talking about weight gain, <strong>Darrelle Revis</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@darrellerevis</a>) was so good during his prime that <strong>Rex Ryan</strong> only had to assign him to cover the opposing team's top wide receiver, and that guy couldn't produce. As a result, the phrase Revis Island was coined to refer to his position on the pitch.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/houseandwhips.com/storage/2023/08/darrelle-revis-after-weight-gain.jpg alt="Darrelle Revis before and after weight gain. houseandwhips.com" width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Darrelle Revis before and after weight gain.<br>Image Source: HOUSE & WHIPS</strong></p><p>However,&nbsp; the former <strong>New York Jets</strong> cornerback's fans now couldn't help but note how different his physique was at his Pro Football Hall of Fame introduction, more than five years after his retirement. With the Jets and Cleveland Browns facing off to start the preseason, much of the attention was on Revis' weight gain physique rather than the game.</p><p>Similarly, many followers made fun of Darrelle Revis' weight gain body, alleging that Revis Island had grown into a continent. Likely, one fan <a href=# rel=noopener>tweeted</a>, "@brgridiron @nyjets did he eat revis island?! jk, glad to see him around again" Another replied, "@brgridiron @nyjets And that island is well stocked with food and beverages." And the third one stated, "@brgridiron @nyjets Man went from CB to DT. That retirement life is good".</p><p>However, Darrelle Revis has yet not disclosed anything regarding his overweight physique. Hope he will soon reveal the actual reason behind his transformation. Till then we wish him a great future ahead.</p><h2>Darrelle Revis Compares His Relationship With Deion Sanders to Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant in His Hall of Fame Speech!</h2><p><strong>Darrelle Revis</strong>' cove abilities in the NFL can be summed up in one word: shutdown. No wide receiver wanted to be on Revis Island in August 2023 because the <strong>New York Jets</strong> star a challenge to face head-on. His records led to his induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame on August 6, and a now fellow Hall of Famer <strong>Deion Sanders</strong> was mentioned during his address after viewing his bronze bust for the first time.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/houseandwhips.com/storage/2023/08/darrelle-revis-hall-of-fame.jpg alt="Darrelle Revis was recently inducted into the Hall of Fame. houseandwhips.com" width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Darrelle Revis was recently inducted into the Hall of Fame.<br>ImageSource: Fox News</strong></p><p>The comparisons between the two cornerbacks came up frequently during Revis' tenure, and he expressed his gratitude while bringing up another iconic sports duo. But not in the NFL – the NBA. He <a href=# rel=noopener>stated</a>,</p><p><strong>I didn’t get the chance to play with this guy named Deion Sanders, but he was the prototype for me. What [Michael] Jordan is to Kobe [Bryant] is what Prime is to Revis Island. You came first and I wanted to play just like you. You were the road map to greatness. Thank you for paving the way.</strong></p><p>It goes without saying that <strong>Jordan</strong> and the late <strong>Bryant</strong> had a special bond both on and off the floor. First, Jordan established himself as possibly the greatest player to ever grace the NBA court.</p><p>Then came Bryant, and while he admired all Jordan had accomplished, he worked tirelessly throughout his career to join the argument about the best of all time. So Revis and Sanders had a similar friendship.</p><p>Revis, a seven-time Pro Bowler and four-time first-team All-Pro selection lived up to the Jets' 14th overall pick in the 2007 NFL Draught. In eight years with the team, he recorded 25 interceptions, three of which were returned for pick-sixes. Revis also made 388 combined tackles and a remarkable 112 passes defended, including 31 during the Jets' march to the AFC Championship Game in 2009.</p><p>When Revis joined the Patriots for a single season in 2014, he also won a Super Bowl. Though Jets supporters were unhappy that he had joined the <strong>AFC East</strong>'s adversary, it worked in his favor, as he earned his fourth and last All-Pro selection that season with 14 passes defended and two interceptions.</p><p>Furthermore, he&nbsp;has always been regarded as one of the best cornerbacks of all time, and he will be remembered among players such as Sanders.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6rApq3Nna6hoaCoe6S7zGibmqqimrmtsYyrnK%2Bho2LEprXGoatmn5Geu3A%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
