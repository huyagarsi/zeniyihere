"Michael's last hoorah, he wanted to win a championship. He thought that if he could get to the playoffs, he could win a championship. I was meant to be traded. They wanted to trade me or Tyson Chandler to the Clippers for Elton Brand."</p><p>During the 2002-03 season, Brand was in the midst of his fourth consecutive year averaging a double-double. The two-time All-Star was a low-post force during his prime, averaging at least 18 points and nine rebounds in his first eight seasons in the NBA.</p><p>Jordan and Brown will forever be linked together. Largely regarded as the greatest player of all time, Jordan hasn't been as successful as an executive, and it all started with drafting Brown No. 1 overall in 2001. The 40-year-old averaged 10 points in a season just once before his retirement in 2013.</p><p>Brown most recently participated in the BIG3 basketball league, while Jordan is the governor of the Charlotte Hornets, who have the second-worst record in the league this year at 11-34 and haven't made the playoffs in six straight seasons.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloZmd9d3%2BMpK6apZVir7O71qdkpqGTna6muIyjpquckaN6uK3NrZydZaSkerW%2BwJ2cZqWVYrOwvoyeo62nnmKvs63NnWSipl2hrrTAjLCgs5mimcBuv8Saqqim</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
