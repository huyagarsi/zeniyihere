What Season of ‘The Bachelorette’ Was Aven Jones On?</b></h3><p class=p1>Aven first appeared on season 19 of <a href=#><i>The Bachelorette</i></a>, ultimately deciding to pursue Rachel over her co-lead <a href=#><strong>Gabby Windey</strong></a>. He made it all the way to the final two before Rachel, 27, dumped him over <a href=#>his hesitancy to get engaged</a> on the accelerated timeline. (Rachel ended up <a href=#>accepting a proposal</a> from <a href=#><strong>Tino Franco</strong></a>, but they split several weeks later after <a href=#>he kissed another woman</a>.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Who-Is-Aven-Jones-5-Things-to-Know-About-the-Bachelor-in-Paradise-Season-9-Contestant-009.jpg><h3 class=p3><b>2. Where Does Aven Jones Stand With Rachel Recchia?</b></h3><p class=p1>After fans watched Rachel and Tino’s emotional breakup during the September 2022 season finale, the exes <a href=#>reunited on <i>After the Final Rose</i></a>. When the conversation reached a stalemate, Aven <a href=#>made a surprise appearance</a> to escort Rachel off the set — and ask her out on a date.</p><p class=p1>“I just care about him so much that I genuinely just want him to be happy in whatever capacity that is with me or, like, whatever it is. I just really want to see him just thriving,” Rachel later gushed about Aven <a href=#>during an October 2022 appearance on the “Off the Vine” podcast</a>. “So what’s to come? I don’t know. I mean, I’m definitely open to seeing what happens but it’s two people, we’ve been through so much,” Rachel said. “I just got back to L.A. from everything that happened [on the] show — New York, I was in Vegas. So I think we’re both kind of just going to see where it goes — if it goes anywhere.”</p><h3 class=p3><b>3.

(After their respective failed romances with <a href=#><strong>Brittany Galvin</strong></a> and<a href=#><strong> Victoria Fuller</strong></a>, Aven took to Twitter to defend his friends’ parts in the breakups.)</p><h3 class=p3><b>4.

How Did Aven Jones Join the Bachelor Nation Franchise?</b></h3><p class=p1>“I got nominated anonymously, so I still to this day don’t know who nominated me,” he said during a September 2022 interview on the <a href=# rel=noopener>“Click Bait With Bachelor Nation” </a>podcast. “I still don’t know. Every time I hang out with a group of friends or family members, I’m always looking around the room trying to figure out which one of them was it. I got contacted by the show and had some conversations with my parents asking if they thought it was a good idea.”</p><p class=p1>Aven added: “My dad wasn’t into the show, but my mom had caught a couple seasons. She thought it was fake and couldn’t be real, but now they’ve seen.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaK6hp12ewG6t1Z6lZqKfo7K0ecyenK1lpJ2ybq7AnJ%2BepJ%2Bneqq6jKmYq5mUnsCmedKemKynnmKGbr%2FTmqlo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
