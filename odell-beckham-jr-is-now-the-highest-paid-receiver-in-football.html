Within just 30 games, he had already snagged 200 receptions and 3,000 yards. That's faster than anyone else in NFL history.</p><p>So perhaps it's no surprise that Beckham is making history once again. The 25-year-old just signed a contract extension with the Giants that makes him the highest-paid wide receiver in the NFL.</p><p>Beckham and the Giants agreed to a five-year extension worth $95 million, with $65 million guaranteed. Beckham's deal surpasses <a href=# rel=noopener>Antonio Brown</a>'s ($17 million) per year average, as well as <a href=# title="Mike Evans Net Worth">Mike Evans</a>'s ($55 million) in total guarantees.</p><p>Beckham, who has been working for a new deal for most of the past two seasons, is now under contract through 2023.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-267620 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/thumn.jpg alt width=704 height=465 sizes="(max-width: 704px) 100vw, 704px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-267620 class=wp-caption-text>Via Getty Images</p><p>His 2018 contract, which was worth $8.4 million, will now be restructured into a $1.459 million salary and a $20 million signing bonus. The restructuring will help the Giants save $3 million against the cap.</p><p>Though he never publicly announced it, the belief around the league was that Beckham – who hasn't played since breaking his ankle last October – was holding out of preseason activities until signing a new contract.</p><p>Now that the deal is done, Beckham can get back to contributing for the Giants. The team will look to bounce back after a disappointing 3-13 season that saw nearly every member of the receiving corps suffer an injury, including Beckham.</p><p>If you think ODB was happy to hear the news, well…you're not wrong. Check out this video Roger Lewis took of his teammate after the deal was done:</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>congrats to my brudda couldn't be more proud been solid since day one helped me a lot on my journey… you deserve it…MONEY MONEY MONEY!!!! <a href=#>@OBJ_3</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/cncsmI7IfB</a></p><p>— Roger Lewis (@OttoLewis_) <a href=#>August 27, 2018</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2FjqibnqScYq%2Bmr8qhmKZlmqd6qr%2BMp6awZaSdsm60yKCfnqukYr2itcNmqZ6blZ7Dpr6MoqVmnp%2BkwaOty6Vm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
