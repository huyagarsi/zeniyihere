The family believes the cause of death was heart failure as he had a history of arrhythmia. They said the death was unrelated to drugs or alcohol, and no substances were found in the home.</p><p>Lancaster was best known for appearing on Road Rules: Latin America, the seventh season of the MTV reality series, back in 1999. An <a href=#>obituary posted online</a> described him as a “jack of all trades,” noting that he had worked as an advertising account manager, a telecommunications project manager, a special education teacher and a bartender.</p><p>“A spiritual explorer, dreamy stargazer, inquisitive world traveler and barstool philosopher who enjoyed a good mind meld, Brian excelled at being a human being rather than a human doing,” reads his obituary. “Constant in his soul and spirit, he would share possessions, thoughts and every part of his essence with anyone who came into his orbit.”</p><p>Lancaster is survived by his fiancée, Sarah J. Bell; his parents, Dennis and Carol Lancaster; his godparents, Ed Lancaster and Janice O’Hara; and his dog, Reagan.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Private memorial services will be held on Thursday, April 5.</p><p>In lieu of flowers, Lancaster’s family has asked that contributions be made in his name to <a href=#>Brandywine Valley SPCA</a>, a no-kill animal shelter in his hometown of West Chester, Pennsylvania.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGarp5GZerPBy56qZpmcqrpurtGimKdlnJa7pK3SrZyrZZSarqV5wK1kbWtf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
