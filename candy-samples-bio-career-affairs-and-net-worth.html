Her mother was staying in a boarding house there. But they later moved to Kansas City, Missouri, to be close to her family. Her real name is Patsy Ruth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Candy-Samples-photo.jpg><p>She had a luxurious childhood, as her grandfather owned a large farm and her step-father also was reasonably well-off. However, Candy felt she lacked the emotional support she needed growing up. As she said,</p><p>“I didn’t have the emotional things that I needed. You know somebody closer, kinder. I grew up by myself.”</p><p>She grew up being quite conservative. Candy didn’t smoke and drank like other girls of her age. She also attended church and loved talking to God in her way. In addition, she liked <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">going to school and dancing</a>. She graduated from high school in the mid-1940s. She later graduated from college with a degree in arts.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=candy-samples-parents>Parents</h2><p>Candy never knew her birth father, and she lived with her stepfather. Her stepfather owned a dry-cleaning store.</p><p>Her mothers had ten sisters, and she was very close to them.</p><p>As per Candy, her grandfather was quite strict, while her grandmother was a sweet, gentle woman who loved everyone and whom everyone loved. Samples also state that she always thought men were not as nice as women because of her relationship with her grandfather and stepfather.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=romantic-relationship-and-affairs>Romantic Relationship and Affairs</h2><p>Candy Samples <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">was in a relationship with many men</a>. Unfortunately, she had a string of bad relationships with men. The rumor is that she was married eight times!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Candy-Samples-Adult-model.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=pat-romano-ex-husband>Pat Romano (Ex-husband)</h3><p>Candy met Pat when she was still modeling. However, she stopped hardcore modeling after she met him. He became her manager, bodyguard, and business partner. Pat was the one who forced her to return to hardcore films in her mid-50s. Sometimes, he would even insist on appearing on some of them.</p><p>Romano took much of her money. He even set up a fan club in the name of Candy. However, he ripped off the members by taking the money but not sending the merchandise.</p><p>Pat was arrested twice for selling drugs. It is rumored that he committed suicide while in prison.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=other-relationships>Other relationships</h3><p>After she left the industry, she married again and moved to Texas. Unfortunately, however, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">that relationship didn’t end too well for her</a>.</p><p>Then, she moved to Arizona and married a former cop. However, he was physically abusive and took all of Candy’s money. So, she decided to move on.</p><p>In 2007, she married again, which ended up in a divorce in 2009. Then, in November, she was married to the same man who drained all her bank accounts.</p><p>Luckily, she was taken care of by her former fan and friend John who was with her till her last breath.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=candy-samples-son>Candy Samples Son</h2><p>Candy had one son with her first husband. She always took good care of her son and ensured that he remained away from her modeling career. He didn’t know that his mother was modeling until he was in college. Candy shared the incident his son found the explicit picture of his mother in a magazine. She recalls,</p><p>“One day, he called me and asked did you know you had a picture of you in the magazine? I said no. And he goes like, ‘Everybody is talking about that picture, and here you are!’ I still don’t know which picture it is, but it must have been crude.”</p><p>So, Candy slowly started losing interest in her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">work and slowed down</a>. However, sadly her son passed away in a car accident.</p><p>Candy often wondered if it was her that caused her son’s death. She never knew her son was doing drugs, and she wondered if that was what caused the accident. Samples always regretted that she was too far away to help her son when he needed her the most. So, it bothered her that maybe she didn’t do the right thing for her son.</p><p>She also has three grandchildren.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=career>Career</h2><p>Candy Samples joined an import/export company after completing her college studies. She traveled to many places while in her job, which she enjoyed.</p><p>She then started working for a modeling agency in California.

A photographer, Dick James, approached her, saying <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">she had a magnificent body</a>. During her initial days as a nude model, she thought it wasn’t a good thing as she grew up in the conservative society of Missouri. However, slowly she gained confidence and enjoyed her work too.</p><p>She then appeared in pornographic movies and some B-movie campy roles. She also took part in some “sexy wrestling” short-footage films, mainly for Triumph Studios and Ron Dvorkin’s Bellstone. Candy has shot almost 96 adult movies.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=list-of-movies>Candy Samples movies</h3><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table class=has-fixed-layout><tr><th><strong>Movie Name</strong></th><th><strong>Role</strong></th><th><strong>Year</strong></th></tr><tbody><tr><td>The Breast of Russ Meyer</td><td><strong>&nbsp;</strong></td><td>2001</td></tr><tr><td>Cock Robin</td><td><strong>&nbsp;</strong></td><td>1989</td></tr><tr><td>Bigger the Better</td><td><strong>&nbsp;</strong></td><td>1988</td></tr><tr><td>Bouncin’ in the USA</td><td><strong>&nbsp;</strong></td><td>1986</td></tr><tr><td>40 Plus: The Video</td><td>The Mistress/ Girl with Fruit</td><td>1986</td></tr><tr><td>The Taste of Candy</td><td>Widow</td><td>1985</td></tr><tr><td>Down and Dirty</td><td><strong>&nbsp;</strong></td><td>1985</td></tr><tr><td>Inside Candy Samples</td><td>Dr. Candy Cox</td><td>1985</td></tr><tr><td>The Best Little Whorehouse in San Francisco</td><td>Fanny Mae</td><td>1985</td></tr><tr><td>Electric Blue 19</td><td><strong>&nbsp;</strong></td><td>1984</td></tr><tr><td>All the Way in!</td><td>Candy Keen</td><td>1984</td></tr><tr><td>Candy’s Big Black Master</td><td>Lady in Red</td><td>1979</td></tr><tr><td>Hey!
