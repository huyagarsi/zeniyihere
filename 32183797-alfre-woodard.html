It's hilarious that there was a shock that Gaga was not nominated last year but Alfre not getting nominated was a shocker because she was brilliant and the film doesn't work without her. Mary was fantastic of course but the two of them make the film.</p><p>I'm not a big fan of Scrooged but Alfre, along with Karen Allen, really help ground the film. Murray acts like he's in a completely different film. I find him really off-putting, especially after learning what an asshole he is. But Alfre lights up every scene she's in.</p><p>I felt bad for Alfre that there was no big push for Clemency. I think she would have been nominated. It's crazy to think she hasn't received another Oscar nomination in almost 40 years.</p><table class="info small" readability=1.5><tr readability=3><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 84</td><td class=timestamp><span>December 19, 2022 7:31 AM</span></td></tr></table><p>at one time she was part of the conversation for Clemency but once again the field was overcrowded with contenders.</p><table class="info small" readability=1.5><tr readability=3><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 85</td><td class=timestamp><span>December 19, 2022 7:34 AM</span></td></tr></table><p>I think Alfre was a co-lead in Passion Fish. I would have liked to see her get nominated alongside Mary McDonnell ala Thelma & Louise the year before. Michelle Pfeiffer should have been nominated for Batman Returns (in supporting or lead, doesn't matter to me). I would have dropped Sarandon in Lorenzo's Oil. She was alright, but not Top 5.</p><table class="info small" readability=1.5><tr readability=3><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 87</td><td class=timestamp><span>December 19, 2022 7:39 AM</span></td></tr></table><p>OK, but one of them was definitely in that movie about the dead husband trying to communicate and warn the wife who was into crafting and the one about the illiterate black girl who writes letter to god and falls in love with a juke joint hussey.</p><table class="info small" readability=1.5><tr readability=3><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 88</td><td class=timestamp><span>December 19, 2022 7:47 AM</span></td></tr></table><p>Imagine Alfre as Lady MacBeth.
