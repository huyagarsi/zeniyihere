But this year, as a result of some smart investing, the 45-year-old wordsmith found himself in a completely different Top 10 list.</p><p>For the first time in his legendary career, Nas found himself on the list of Forbes' Hip Hop Cash Kings list, which reports the hip-hop acts who have made the most money over the past year. Nas, who turned 45 this past Friday, earned $35 million over the past year, which was good enough to put him in a tie with <a href=# title="Dr Dre Net Worth">Dr. Dre</a> for the No. 6 spot on the list. The rapper's appearance on the list shouldn't come as much of a surprise to those who have been paying attention to some of his business moves though.</p><p>Back in 2016, <a href=#>we ran a story</a> that outlined Nas' venture capital tech investment firm, Queensbridge Venture Partners. In a 2016 interview with Fast Company, the "Made You Look" rapper revealed that he had been interested in investing since he was a young boy. At the time, we reported that QVP was investing anywhere from $100,000 to $500,000 in a company, and were pitched by roughly 100 companies per month.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-268958 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/GettyImages-533132526.jpg alt width=594 height=401 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-268958 class=wp-caption-text>(Craig Barritt/Getty Images for Italia Independent New York City, LLC)</p><p>Fast forward to today, and Nas is raking in millions from his investments; most notably Ring, a smart doorbell company that was purchased by Amazon for $1.1 billion earlier this year. Queensbridge Venture Partners invested $4.5 million in a Series A investment round back in July 2014. Amazon also purchased PillPack for $1 billion, an online pharmacy company that QVP invested in back in 2014.</p><p>Don't expect this trend to stop anytime soon. Nas' venture capital firm has invested in a variety of different companies, including Lyft, Coinbase, Genius, and Mass Appeal, and will undoubtedly continue their search for the next big thing.</p><p>"[Hip-hop artists] are always advancing technologyâ€”from one turntable to two turntables and a fader," said Nas to Forbes. "There wasn't a time when [rappers] didn't think about investing. It just so happens that the world is opening up."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcLnUrKCcZZ6axLR7zZqqZqyVmLVutc2vnKysnZq7tb%2BMmqmeZaCWxqq6xmamn55dnrturYyboKBlp5bGcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
