Nashville-based celebrity trainer <strong>Erin Oprea</strong> shared supercute pics of an outdoor group workout with country singers <a href=#><strong>Kelsea Ballerini</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Maren Morris</strong></a> and <strong>Carly Pearce</strong>.</p><p>Holding weights and flexing their biceps, Oprea and her fit girl group were all smiles in the mid-workout photo.</p><p>“I wish all of you could be a fly on the wall for this killer session, nothing but Sweat, Laughter, and Good music. It really never happens that clients can workout together because everybody is ALWAYS so busy, so this was a BLAST!! @kelseaballerini @marenmorris @carlypearce are BADASS women that give it their all!” she captioned the two Instagram pics she shared on Tuesday, July 3.</p><p>All three singers also shared the selfie. “Lots of country booty kickin’ today with @erinoprea,” wrote Carly Pearce. Meanwhile, Maren Morris said, “Turns out @erinoprea knows to make us all sweat out our transgressions.” Kelsea Ballerini also had some more fun captioning the photo: “3 country singers walk into an @erinoprea workout…”</p><p>Oprea typically trains each woman individually, but tells Us Weekly in an exclusive interview she couldn’t turn down the chance for the impromptu sweat session. “With their touring schedules, they’re almost never in the same place at the same time. But they all happened to be in town and we were going over to meet Maren’s puppy, Pancake, and we turned it into a workout party!”</p><p>And while the photos made it seem like more of a party than a workout, the singers had to put in serious effort to complete the intense full-body moves. The main focus was Tabata, a high-intensity interval training technique that is a staple of Oprea’s training sessions. “We did lots of legs,” notes Oprea. “We did one Tabata that was sumo squats for round one and sumo squat jumps for round two, back and forth for eight rounds.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Oprea then moved on to core work. “Lots and lots of abs — we did 40 butterfly crunch pulses followed by elbow planks with hip dips for 30 seconds, then side planks for 30 seconds each,” adds the Marine-turned-trainer.</p><p>And the workout wasn’t complete, of course, without some attention to their backsides. Notes the trainer: “For booty, we did 20 table slides right into 20 fire hydrant circles.”</p><p>“It was all about good vibes, good music, good company and everybody laughing and cheering each other on,” Oprea, who trains some of country music’s biggest stars including Carrie Underwood, Kacey Musgraves and Jana Kramer, tells Us. “There definitely wasn’t a dull moment during the workout and it was full of positive energy.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGaknZyosqJ5wZqjpZ2inruqecyaqZ6mXaK8s77IrGSappRisKK%2By7JkqZ2Rp7CmedaoqaRln6rBbsDOoJytoJWnerG1wqxm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
