The former college basketball player’s net worth might pale in comparison to the wealth of prominent hip hop names like Drake and Jay Z, but he remains one of the most successful acts of modern hip hop. This article takes a look at his net worth, along with how he made his significant wealth, succeeding where others have failed.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=2-chainz-net-worth></span><strong>2 Chainz Net Worth</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Before he was 2 Chainz, he was Tity Boi and Drenchgod, and with that name, he has achieved a net worth of $6 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. Sources of his net worth include music, TV, and business investments. However, while there are a couple of things to point to as the source of 2 Chainz’s admirable net worth, it is his distinctive personality that has helped him become one of hip hop’s millionaires, especially after his music stopped setting the charts on fire.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=he-has-a-successful-music-career></span><strong>He Has a Successful Music Career</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>If there is a pie chart about the contributors to 2 Chainz’s net worth, music will take more than 50% of the whole. He has sold more than two million album copies and sold even more via singles.</p><p>He began his music career in 1997 as part of the hip hop duo, Playaz Circle. While he was a member of the group, he released two albums, United We Stand, United We Fall, which introduced him to the Atlanta hip hop music world and got him and his partner, Earl Conyers, aka Dolla Boy, a record deal with Ludacris’ Disturbing Tha Peace. Their second album, Supply & Demand, was released in 2007.</p><p>In 2011, 2 Chainz released his first charting mixtape, T.R.U REALigion, which peaked at number 54 on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Prior to the mixtape release, he has released six mixtapes, his first being Me Against the World.</p><p>His first album, Based on a T.R.U Story, was released in 2012 and has sold more than one million copies after selling 147,000 copies in the first week amidst mixed reviews. At this time, 2 Chainz became a popular name in hip hop with singles like No Lie and Birthday Song, and he was earning $100,000 to feature on a track.</p><p>So far, 2 Chainz has released five albums, with his last being Rap or Go to the League, which he released in March 2019. The album received strong critical reviews and performed modestly well commercially. It debuted on number four on the Billboard 200 and sold 65,000 copies in the first week.</p><p>The significant percentage of 2 Chainz’s $6 million net worth earned through music, comes from a discography with five studio albums, ten mixtapes, four EPs, and over 95 singles, several of which have been certified gold or platinum. He has also earned royalty from the use of his songs as a soundtrack in more than 45 projects, including films, TV shows, and video games.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=2-chainz-is-a-burgeoning-tv-star></span> <strong>2 Chainz </strong><strong>is a burgeoning TV star</strong><br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Even when his music began to lose their popularity, 2 Chainz continued to maintain his net worth with a career in television. He has appeared as an actor on the shows, Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, 2 Broke Girls, and the TV movie, Rubberhead.</p><p>While he had minor roles in those projects, 2 Chainz took a more prominent position on the Viceland show, Most Expensivest. The reality show began airing in 2017, and the Georgia-born rapper, who stars at the show’s host and protagonist, has been on the air for three seasons so far, with more than 40 aired episodes.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=he-is-quite-the-business-investor></span><strong>He is quite the business investor</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Another major contributor to 2 Chainz’s net $6 million net worth is his business investments.
