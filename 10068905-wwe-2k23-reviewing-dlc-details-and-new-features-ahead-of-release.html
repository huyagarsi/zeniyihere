There are more showrunners to choose from, including <i>Up Up, Down Down</i>'s Xavier Woods and Tyler Breeze, as well as Hall of Fame authority figures, Mick Foley and Eric Bischoff.</p><p>There are even more shows to choose from, including NXT, NXT 2.0, and even WCW.</p><p>Yes, you can resurrect WCW and put it in direct competition with Raw, and bring back the fabled Monday Night Wars.</p><p>Perhaps the best addition, though, is the introduction of seasons. Rather than simply ending when the predetermined number of weeks is up, players can advance into a new season. It is a welcome addition to a mode that was already a ton of fun for strategic players.</p><p>The MyGM mode is the most interesting and intricate mode in the game and in this writer's opinion, the tops for players who want to use existing Superstars to build a WWE brand in their vision.</p><p><i>Listen to Ring Rust Radio for all of the hot wrestling topics.
