But I've been through a lot of things in life. Injuries is a part of being an athlete."</p><p>Jones had been scheduled to defend the UFC heavyweight title against Miocic, but he suffered a torn pectoral tendon in training, and said he planned to undergo surgery Friday.</p><p>While Jones now faces a long road to recovery and Miocic is off the UFC 295 card as well, Jones insisted that he will work toward making the fight against Miocic happen down the line, saying: "The goal is to get surgery [Friday] and get back to work as soon as possible. I guess it'll be Stipe and I at a later date. That's my plan. It'll be surgery and physical therapy for me for the next several months. But I'm committed.

He has not fought since UFC 260 in March 2021 where he dropped the heavyweight title to Ngannou.</p><p>Per Raimondi, Miocic said, "I want that belt back," in reference to the UFC heavyweight title, before adding, "It's my belt. It's going to happen."</p><p>With Jones vs. Miocic off for UFC 295, Sergei Pavlovich vs. Tom Aspinall has been included as an interim UFC heavyweight title fight.</p><p>While Miocic was unsure why he was not included in the bout, UFC president Dana White said it would have been an "insult" to Miocic to put him in the fight given his career accomplishments.</p><p>The light heavyweight fight between Alex Pereira and Jiří Procházka has been elevated to main event status for UFC 295 at Madison Square Garden in New York City.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloaWp9eYKMo6anZZqku6a%2FjJqnqKSfnLa7sdJmq6hlo6m2sbGMpqCom5mYeqKy056pZqGen8KzxYyfpqublZl6psTIrWSfqp%2BieraywmZpcm1dm7aotNM%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
